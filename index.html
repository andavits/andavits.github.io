<div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:rgb(11,83,148)"><b>--- ABOUT ME---</b></span></div>
<p>I am a retired developer, now focused on computation statistical data analysis. In the broad field of data science, my focus is on statistical analysis of social and psychological behaviour, which is relevant anywhere humans are involved in all industries. This is something that I always have wanted to do in my career; so when the R programming language became mainstream as a statistical programming language, along with the advances in computing power, it was time to relearn and upgrade my statistical skills and do this. No more excuses! Now here I am - able - and am pursuing this for at least 10 more years. </p>

<p>I have ongoing hobbies that sometimes have been my primary income. What I learned from those experiences is that with regards to creative activities, it is best to keep them as hobbies. Creativity is my life-force, so the focus of the end result, instead of the journey getting there, was not good for my soul.</p>

<p>Statistical data analysis is problem solving, which is creative, but in a different way. Being on a team of problem solvers using peer-reviewed and accepted scientific methods employing collective shared intelligence spanning centuries is mindblowing. The science of data is a zen environment to work in, in that the knowledge changes in a gradual organic way, without sudden surprises. It then leaves me to sort through all the industry and government collected data I am analysing to see patterns among real and lurking variables, feeling confident that the tools to do this are robust.</p>

<dd>STATISTICS - THE SCIENCE OF DATA<br>
Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, and interpreting numerical facts, which we call <i>data</i>. Data are numbers with <i>context</i>. In practice, any set of data is accompanied by background information that helps us understand the data. When starting new project, the following are the first questions we ask: 
<ul><li>why important: why? 
	<ul><li>What <i>purpose</i> does the data have?</li>
		<li>Do we hope to answer some specific questions?</li>
		<li>Do we want to draw conclusions about individuals other than those for whom we actually have the data?</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>what's it about? who?
		<ul><li>What <i>individuals</i> do the data describe?</li>
			<li><i>How many</i> individuals appear in the data?</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>details? what?
		<ul><li>How many <i>variables</i> do the data contain?</li>
			<li>What are the <i>exact definitions</i> of these variables? In what <i>unit of measure</i> is each variable recorded?</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<dd>INTRODUCING R - <i>the scripting language of data science</i><br>
	The big practical advantage of R over applications like SPSS is that it is easy for anyone to replicate the analysis, as it is scripted. The links provide an introduction to what it is about.
