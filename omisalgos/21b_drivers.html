			<li>The 5 predominant drivers in out lives are:
				<ul><li>BE PERFECT</li>
					<li>PLEASE OTHERS</li>
					<li>TRY HARD</li>
					<li>HURRY UP</li>

			<li>Drivers create tension</li>
			<li>They put us into high gear</li>
			<li>A natural pace is not sufficient</li>
			<li>We must be better, faster, and if this is not achieved, we consider ourselves inadequate</li>
			<li>A driver is buoyed up be a forced motivation, a pressure from the imposed self that may have no connection at all to a person’s inner well of aliveness and energy</li>

	<dt>PERMITTERS</dt>

		<ul><li>Permitters are specific permission that either prevent or relieve the effect of a driver. The more we operate by affirmers, the more we can freely choose to do things well, to please others, etc.

<p>Using the following decision scales, access the drivers and their respective permitters. The more important the driver, (the more you adhere to its demands), the closer you will rate yourself toward the zero of the scale. Indicate where you see yourself now and where you were on the scale 5, 10, or 15 years ago. The difference represents your positive movement away from drivers (hopefully).</p>

<p>Helping professions are particularly vulnerable to the Try Hard Driver. Helping people in need, these people often ignore their own personal limits and tale on the problems of their clients as if these problems were their own. This leads to “burn out” where we end up with nothing left to give in terms of physical, emotional or intellectual energy. </p>

<p>Society reinforces those who Hurry Up, setting short deadlines and meeting them is rewarded with promotions and acclaim. The cost of the overwork is frequently not experienced until later, when friends, family and important parts of one’s self have been discarded and left behind. Leads to generalizing a need for alertness and speed in one area to other situations where a broader degree of permission is possible.</p>
