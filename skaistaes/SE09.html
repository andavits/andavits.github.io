<dl>
<dt>Common story = just when given up on cherished dream, only to discover it come to them.</dt>
<dt>What is this mysterious force that delivers what desire only when stop trying to get it? Appears cruel.</dt>
<dt>Seems like life saying, “Don’t want something too much!”</dt>

<dd>-&gt; so then we play games...
<ul>Acting as if we dn want something, in secret hope that the pretended indifference will turn the magic key.
<li>If looks possible that get cherished goal, then “knock on wood” in hoop that act will prevent which from running away.</li></ul>
</dd>
<dd>-&gt; religious attempts to manifest desires...
<ul><li>Sacrifice animals and humans to gods.</li>
<li>Conducting elaborate rituals.</li></ul>
</dd>
<dd>-&gt; current cultural beliefs...
<ul><li>“My wish may be granted if I do 1 or more of following” /give $ to charity / attend church / helpful to parents / work overtime / write affirmations / forgive people who have wronged me / inc my sense of self worth / promise that I won’t keep all the money if I win the lottery / feng shui my home / create an altar / meditate every day / </li></ul>
</dd>
<div>=&gt; just like ancestors &nbsp;- we still don’t have a clue about how to get what we want.

</div>
</dl>
<ul><li><b>Like dog chasing “tail” - we end up chasing out “tales”</b>, repeatedly doing activities that dn yield results<br>
...and if we do finally catch something - are mystified by what exactly made it happen.</li>
<li><b>Could problem be that we are neither aware of nor interested in needs and desires of others?</b></li></ul>

<dl>
<dt>examples</dt>
<dd>Want to date person. “How do I get him/her?” you ask. -&gt; reality - IF they dn want you THEN end of story 
<ul><li>(doing activities like charity, church... listed above, won’t change a thing)</li></ul>
</dd>
<dd>IF want job BUT people hiring dn want you THEN above rituals will not help
<ul><li>The job has its own requirements/needs &amp; you may no be the right match.</li></ul>

<b><code>therefore make sure dreams/goals are not nationalistically orientated</code></b><code> (as if other person’s desires/needs do not count or even exist)</code></div>
