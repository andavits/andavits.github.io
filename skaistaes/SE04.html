<dl>
<dt>The <i>Power</i> that created me, has put everything here for me.</dt>
<dd>-&gt; therefore <i>up to me to deserve and accept</i></dd>
<dt>whatever have now - is what I have accepted</dt>
<dd>IF want something different THEN 
<ul><li><u>do not</u> get by complaining</li>
<li><u>do</u> get by expanding consciousness</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dt><b>Accepting Income</b></dt>
<dd>everyday I love myself -&gt; open to new avenues of income</dd>
<dd>no “fixed &nbsp;income” -&gt; go beyond parents income</dd>
<dd>One Infinite Universe &nbsp;- has all incomes everyone makes -&gt; “I <i>accept</i> healthy income for myself.”<br>
i.e. the income I am presently making reflects my beliefs/deservability
<ul><li><u>is not</u> about “getting”</li>
<li><u>is</u> allowing myself to accept</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>=&gt; “<i>My increase financial status reflects my changing beliefs about income.</i>” “ <i>I bless my income with love -&gt; and watch it grow</i>”</dd>

<dt><b>Deserving</b></dt>
<dd><u>do not</u> believe that deserve only a little bit</dd>
<dd><u>do</u> believe 
<ul><li>there is no limit of good</li>
<li>learn practical things (clean room, eat well, quiet...) AND learn <i>self-worth</i></li></ul>
</dd>
<dd>i.e. I know that I am<i> already good enough</i>, and <i>without changing anything at all</i>, I deserve a wonderful life.</dd>
<dd>“I deserve best in life. I am open to most splendid experiences”</dd>
<dd>“I open my arms wide and declare with love that <i>I deserve and accept all good</i>.</dd>

<dt><span style="line-height:1.6;font-size:10pt;background-color:transparent"><b>Prosperity</b></span></dt>
<dd>prosperity begins with feeling good about self.
<ul><li>&gt;IF do not feel good about self THEN cannot really enjoy anything</li>
<li>-&gt; what have, are reflections of what I believe I deserve (home, car, clothing, friends, health, bank acct.)</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>true prosperity
<ul><li>is about state of mind<br>
<u>is not</u> about amount of money</li>
<li>-&gt; therefore “<i>my mind is now open to receiving prosperity</i>.”</li>
<li>Once/day, stretch arms out wide and say “<i>I am open and receptive to all the good and abundance in the Universe. Thank you, Life.</i>”</li></ul>
</dd>
<dd>“I have prosperity consciousness. I always have everything I need.”</dd>

<li>Receiving graciously: Appreciation and acceptance act like powerful magnets for miracles every moment of the day. If somebody compliments me, I smile and say thank you. Compliments are gifts of prosperity. I have learned to accept them graciously.</li>
<li>Today is a sacred gift from<i> Life</i>. I open my arms wide and receive the full measure of prosperity that the <i>Universe</i> offers this day. Any time of the day or night, I can let it in.</li>
<li>I know that there are times in life when the Universe gives to me, and I am not in a position to do anything about giving back. I can think of many people who really helped me so much at a time when there was no way I could repay them. Later, I have been able to help others, and that is how life goes.</li>

<dt><b>Caregiving</b></dt>
<dd><u>ourselves</u>: Our bodies are miracles, that heal themselves. I nurture, not control, by listening and responding to what it asks for.</dd>
<dd><u>caregiving</u>: Whether care-giver or care-receiver, loving myself is most important, because it can become overwhelming job.</dd>

<dt><b>Humor</b></dt>
<dd>Avoid <b>bad humor</b>: because subconscious mind has no sense of humor. It takes everything literally, like young child.</dd>
<dd>What is bad humor? denigrations, putdowns.
<dl>
<dt>IF negative joke, put-down about self -&gt; “Oh, it dn mean anything.””I’m only kidding myself.”</dt>
<dd>THEN <i>subconscious mind still accepts as true </i>-&gt; creates situations accordingly.</dd>
<dt>IF put-downs, inappropriate jokes at others</dt>
<dd>THEN still under law “What I give out will come back to me.”</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
<dd>vs<b> good humor</b>: laughing lovingly, appreciating the situation -&gt; feel good, and is easier to relax and find solution.</dd>
<dt><b>Gossip</b></dt>
<dd>IF hear <u>positive</u> story THEN <u>share</u></dd>
<dd>IF hear <u>negative</u> story THEN <u>dn share</u>. because under law that will come back to me.</dd>
