<dt><b>Accept Compliments</b></dt>
<dd>= <b>Accept graciously, say thank you.</b></dd>
<dd>IF Life gives to those who cannot receive THEN as soon as can receive, life gives.</dd>
<dd><b>Celebrate life’s giving</b>:
<ul><li>Receive the pleasure of living in a world where people compliment you, are kind to you &amp; considerate of you. Be genuinely appreciative. Be excited by it! Celebrate! Life’s abundance is everywhere... and the more you notice it, the more life gives.</li></ul>

<dt><b>Gratitude / Appreciation</b></dt>
<dd>= <b>being receptive to life’s abundance</b></dd>
<dd>Is within a person (completely independent of external circumstances)</dd>
<dd>inc focus on gratitude -&gt; inc capacity to receive</dd>
<dd>Receive manifest goals bc they appreciate goals</dd>
<dd>Gratitude rules (to strengthen receive Muscles)
<ul><li>Say you are grateful (Giver appreciated &amp; inc probability that Give again)</li>
<li>No degree of gratitude (not more grateful for one thing over other. Brain just registers “gratefulness”)</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><b>Be Authentic / Self-Revealing</b></dt>
<dd>IF embrace wholeness THEN others will also
<ul><li>easier to bond when come across as human (kindred spirit) / is relaxing to be in the presence of imperfect being &amp; easier to manifest when relaxed.</li></ul>
</dd>

<dt><b>Complaints Fast</b></dt>
<dd>= <b>No complaints about your story (telling your victim story)</b></dd>

<ul><li>push away (do not draw things towards you)</li>
<li>discharge energy (w/o changing outcome)</li>
<li>are about story - rather than feelings</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>DO stay in touch w/feelings (<u>receive</u> circumstances) (ex. feel unappreciated)</dd>
<dd>DO NOT catalog injustices (<u>deflect</u> circumstances) (ex. whine of boss &amp; job)</dd>
<dd>=&gt; when talk about FEELINGS - both you and others relate
<ul><li>speak your EXPERIENCES, not your storyline</li>
<li>IF impulse to complain THEN check w/emotions instead<br>

<dt><b>Change "good person" cultural view =&gt; "whole person" Universal view</b></dt>
<dd><b>problem: The societal “good person” role - tells what <u>should</u> give &amp; not what <u>want to</u> give.</b>
<ul><li>Considered <i>selfish</i>, if someone could benefit from your time, attention, help</li>
<li>IF you dn see yourself as important THEN why would you Goal perceive you as ideal choice for manifesting its desire. Broadcasting to yourself/others that you are a “<i>good person</i>” whose needs &amp; desires are less important than those of others!</li>

<ul><li>IF goal = better job THEN there is a better candidate than you.</li>

<dd><i>Monk story</i>: after religious training -&gt; beg for alms</dd>
<dd>= <b>declaration of unity (Giver-Receiver are One)</b>
<ul><li>We are all in this together</li>
<li>Experience pleasure of grateful recipient<br>
-&gt; obvious at that moment that giving-receiving are flip sides of the same coin.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd><i>exercise</i>:
<ul><li><b>Think of <u>Self </u>as monk w/bowl, red to receive love, kindness, respect, affection.</b></li>
<li><b>Think of<u> Goal</u> as person who wants to honor you &amp; give to you.</b></li>

<dd>Help Goal &amp; Yourself by seeing Receiving as an act of generosity that demonstrates your wholeness &amp; your connection with others.</dd>

<dt><b>Unity Principle includes You</b></dt>

<li>They come &amp; go like a wave in ocean &lt;Dala Lama&gt;</li></ul>

<dd>=&gt; integrating, receiving, embracing all aspects of self -&gt;
<ul><li>Prevents us from becoming involved w/unhealthy relationships</li>
<li>Powerful expression of Self-love</li></ul>

<dd>DO NOT set up blocks for Goal to reach You (include you)
