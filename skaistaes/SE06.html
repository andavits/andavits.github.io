<dt><b>The Natural story</b> (both giving-receiving &amp; reaching their goals -&gt; self-perpetuating)</dt>
<dd>“Butterfly bushes. Called this because butterflies are drawn like a magnet to their bright colors &amp; sweet fragrance. These delicate creatures drink the nectar, and as they move from flower to flower, they carry sticky pollen from one butterfly bush to another.”</dd>
<dt><b>Current Society</b> (how we were taught)</dt>
