<div style="text-align:center"><b><u style="background-color:rgb(217,234,211)">RELEASING HABITS</u></b> <br>
</div>
<div style="text-align:center">A review for me and my new spirit <font size="1">(by Anda Vitols)</font><br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>My body and psychology function as is shown in the science of psychology. I see that it has these needs and hungers. They still need to be addressed, so that negative habits do not become addictions. As grown up, am free, physically and mentally, to move out of any negative space. So lets review what negative habits are, and how to avoid them, get out of them, so as not to get caught up in self-imposed cycle of doom.&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="white-space:pre">	</span></div>
<div>A bad habit &nbsp;means addiction. The best is prevention. Check that not caught in too much drugs, alcohol; too much or too little eating, sex, people; too much destructive mind games, such as blaming and judging people, debt, being victim, being rejected.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Start with good immune system for body and mind. <u>Give self good dose of unconditional love every day</u>, and immune system will register these thoughts and feelings. “<i>Life is a joy, and I am lovable, and my needs are always met.</i>” Consequently, my immune system is supported, and more easily fight off dis-ease. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>When ready to let go of habit, it becomes an issue in my mind. “<i>Issue</i>”<i> is an entity inside that wants to be loved</i>, but does not feel loved.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Go to a higher state, Universe, and remind myself how to let go of fear, and then how to pattern in a more healthy habit. <i>Love dissolves fear. Safety is within the meridians of Oneness</i>. When love self, the shining light inside, can right away see connection to the Universe, which I know from experience is always gentle and positively motivating. It is safe.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>From there, I tell myself that my <i>friendship with my habit is outgrown</i>. I loved it, because it served some need. When the net results grew negative, I release my lovable friend. It’s time for both of us to move on. So never trying to fix myself, or trying to be perfect. What addiction is are friendships, and friendships cycle, as move from one life stage to another. Same for friends, and friends of habit.</div>
<div><span style="white-space:pre">	</span>If the habit is really getting nasty, yet I still continue to hold onto its friendship, I will start feeling guilty, ashamed, cowardice and weak. This is when there is much more power in the habit than in me. It’s a master-slave relationship. It requires Nature’s balance, and thank goodness, that’s exactly Nature’s strongest attribute. “<i>Now is the &nbsp;time I <b>take my power back</b>,” to move with Nature’s Karma. I get internal strength to do this by <b>forgiving myself</b> </i>for letting bad habit overpower me, and for thinking of myself as weak.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Forgiveness. Denial-anger-depression-acceptance. Acknowledge feelings. Feel angry and depressed as accept them as my personal history. That’s the goal. I know the facts, but place no judgement on the issue.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Now I have more strength, and can put in place a plan to evolve within Nature’s balance. So <u>not</u> replacing one habit with another, fueling the initial friendship habit. Is <u>not</u> about controlling, fixing. <i><u>Is</u> going to a higher space - set the tone, the big picture, and then flow, being fluid in the present moment</i>. &nbsp;</div>
