<div>“Everything is energy and that’s all there is to it. Match the frequency of the reality you want and you cannot help but get that reality. It can be no other way. This is not philosophy. This is physics.” &lt;Albert Einstein&gt;</div>

<dl>
<dt><i><b>Quantum theory</b>:</i></dt>
<dd>Ideas of local and non-local space /particles &amp; waves</dd>
<dd><b>local space </b>= where you are right now</dd>
<dd><b>non-local space</b> = everything else
<ul><li>ex. while wife think of dishwasher, husband buying it.</li>
<li>nonlocal space = link/info that accessed by husband and wife

<ul><li>they were not in each others physical presence or connected with telephone<br>
they had not had conversation about dishwasher<br>
-&gt; tf both received <i>idea</i> of dishwasher from <i>Big Circle</i></li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><b><i>All energy/info in Big Circle:</i></b></dt>
<dd>-&gt; BUT takes observer to particle-ize specific energy/info (bring it into existence)</dd>
<dd>	energy idea wave, that dn really land anywhere.</dd>

<dt><b><i>Big Circle operates outside of time &amp; space =&gt; is the present:</i></b></dt>
<dd>ex. Which comes 1st, wife’s idea of dishwasher or husband’s purchase of dishwasher?
<ul><li>ans. neither. Both husband &amp; wife are observers of idea of dishwasher</li>
<li>-&gt; after dishwasher installed &amp; neither observing anymore <i>idea is still in Big Circle</i> has not disappeared /is energy wave again

<ul><li><b>IF bring attention to dishwasher THEN particle-ized again</b><br>
<b>IF attention elsewhere THEN energy wave again</b></li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt><b>Particle-izing your goal</b></dt>
<dd>anything, everything, including Goal is in Big Circle</dd>
<dd>tf Goal requires observer to bring it into manifestation&nbsp;
<ul><li>ELSE is energy-humming bundle of info, potential, possibility</li></ul>
</dd>
<dd>Goal connects with you once You form relationship with it (or has the Goal particle-ized you?)
<ul><li>=&gt;concl. entering Big Circle is prerequisite for Goal manifestation</li></ul>

<dt>man - ifest (man = turn to human earth sphere)</dt>
<dt><i>Exercises to gain entrance to Big Circle</i>:</dt>
<dd>accept compliments, write gratitudes, be spiritually naked,&nbsp;</dd>
<dd>experience any one of states in Receptive states word list, not complaining</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><u>Stay in present (Big Circle) with Breathing</u></dt>
<dd>Do exercises anywhere
<ul><li>esp. during times when are frustrated, waiting (which can cause you to go into “suffering past” timeframe)</li></ul>
</dd>
<dd><i>adv. Focus on receptive states</i>
<ul>It helps you know what you are feeling (receptive state)
<li>It inc your awareness of those in your environment (awareness = receptive state)</li>
<li>It relaxes you (relaxation = receptive state)</li>
<li>It gives you the experience of <i>allowing life to be your partner</i>, rather than trying to control life (allowing = receptive state)</li>
<li>It reminds you that life is about receiving as well as giving (receiving = receptive state)</li></ul>
</dd>
<dd>When breath in-out what <u>dn like</u> about self
<ul><li>-&gt; stay w/exercise; uncomfort dissipates w/in a few minutes</li>
<li>or IF Taught that unseemly, boastful to admit have traits that like about self<br>
-&gt; continue exercise: accept &amp; include all these personal feelings</li></ul>
</dd>
<dd>Suppression - dn make feeling go away / does make feeling stronger
<ul><li>-&gt; include acceptance &amp; nonacceptance into Big Circle<br>
tf helps you receive &amp; integrate full array of your feelings</li></ul>
</dd>

<dt><u>Your Senses as Entranceway</u></dt>
<dd>Senses = seeing, touching, hearing, tasting, smelling
<ul><li>trigger past memories, future anticipations (<b>just remember past w/o judgement is good</b>)</li>
<li>experience to present -&gt; entrance to Big Circle (<b>present where grow</b>)</li></ul>
</dd>
<dd>We minimize other senses, when pay attention to one.</dd>
<dd>6th sense: intuitive flashes, psychic premonitions are all from Big Circle
<ul><li>The 5 senses serve as conduits into Big Circle -&gt; which can lead to 6th sense (telepathic ability) with practice strengthen</li></ul>
</dd>
<dt><u>Receiving and Listening</u></dt>
<dd>Talking to someone who is not receiving what you are saying is frustrating
<ul><li>-&gt;inability to listen - interferes with relationships</li></ul>

<dt>Big Circle = Oneness - where experience your connection to everything</dt>
<dt><b>Little Circle</b> = 
</dt>
<dd>stuff we cast out of Big Circle</dd>
<dd>Fixed in tine &amp; space - related to suffering past-fantasy future / pleasurable past-anxious future</dd>

<dt><i>Stuff we put into Little Circle:</i></dt>
<dd>Repository of all disowned, un-acknowledged, uncomfortable bits &amp; parts</dd>
<dd>Feelings we dn embrace, people we look down or up to, ideas we dismiss</dd>
<dt><i>What Little Circle inhabitants do:</i></dt>
<dd>Inhibits manifestation of Goals</dd>
<dd>Runs your life from behind the scenes, from subconscious</dd>
<dd>Behaves like a maverick with its own agenda</dd>
<dd>Interferes with what you want</dd>
<dt><i>What do Little Circle mavericks want?</i> -&gt; <b>inclusion</b></dt>
</dl>

<div style="border:solid orange 3.0pt;padding:.2in 0.2in 0.2in 0.2in">

<div><b><u style="background-color:rgb(252,229,205)">Inclusion</u></b></div>
<div>Everything/everyone in Little Circle wants to be included in Big Circle party, be welcomed, and know their <span style="white-space:pre">	</span>company is desired.</div>

<dl>
<dt><u>Psychology behind inclusion</u></dt>
<dd>Dislike those who won’t let you join in -&gt; cause you trouble, undermine you.</dd>
<dd>They dn go anywhere (ignoring them won’t make them go away.)</dd>
<dd>Countries outcasts = terrorists</dd>
<dd>Your external outcasts = people who do things behind your back</dd>
<dd>Your internal outcasts = operate clandestinely from within</dd>
<dd>example:
<ul><li>prob. IF <u>anger</u> in <i>Little Circle</i> THEN operate behind scene: easily irritated or attracted to bullies</li>
<li>soln. IF <u>anger &amp; peace</u> in <i>Big Circle</i> THEN we are empowered to decide whether we want to be angry or peaceful</li></ul>
</dd>
<dd>Takes much energy to keep things in Little Circle
<ul><li>bc must keep eye on them / dn trust them / repulsed or fearful of them</li></ul>
</dd>

<dt><u>Summary</u></dt>
<dd>IF make Little Circle feelings/thoughts/ideas/people conscious&nbsp;
<ul><li>THEN have power to decide what to do / how to think, about them (transform or heal them.infinite options)</li></ul>
</dd>
<dd><b>Receive everything - decide later</b>
<ul><li>esp. uncomfortable feelings, defeatist addiction urges &amp; controlling or critical impulses</li></ul>
</dd>
<dd>Every time bring something out of Little Circle and move it to Big Circle, you reclaim your wholeness/power</dd>

<dt><u>Exercise - Inviting</u></dt>
<dd>Spend day inviting everyone (global, external, internal) into personal sphere (even if only in mind)</dd>
<dd>-&gt; make decision about them later (dn have to be best friends) <b>just receive</b></dd>
