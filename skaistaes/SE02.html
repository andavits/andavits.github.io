<div><b>Spiritual Philosophy</b></div>
<div><i>I have found a concept of God as Oneness Entity that supports m</i>e. My understanding is based on<i> love</i>. I connect with the <i>Power</i> that create me.</div>
<dl>
<dt><u>About Power</u>:&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>The reality of my being is always connected with the <i>Power </i>that created me.</dd>
<dd>I feel steady, secure as connect with <i>One Infinite Intelligence, Eternal Power</i>, that created me and Universe.</dd>
<dd>I feel Power within me, every nerve and cell, and it knows it’s <i>good</i>.</dd>

<dt><u>About Love</u>:</dt>
<dd><i>Love of Universe</i> surrounds and dwells with me. I am worthy of this love, I accept it, and therefore its <i>healing powers</i>.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>God as Oneness</b></dt>
<dd>Eyes of &nbsp;love</dd>
<dd>Nature of God to be present everywhere. To be all-powerful and all-knowing.</dd>
<dd>I am a <i>Beloved Child of the Universe</i>, and the Universe lovingly takes care of me. When I need something, I turn to the <i>Power</i> that created me. I ask for what I need, and then give thanks even before receiving, knowing that it will come to me in perfect time/space sequence.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><b>Natural and Spiritual Laws</b></dt>
<dd>1) Knowledge of Spiritual Laws. 2) Love working with them in all areas of life.&nbsp;</dd>
<dd><u>Learning spiritual laws like learning computer</u>: When calmly, slowly, patiently learn step-by-step procedures for computer, works beautifully - magic. IF dn follow computer’s laws to letter THEN nothing or wrong. Dn budge and inch -&gt; can get frustrated, but computer just waits patiently until I learn the laws, and then it gives magic.&nbsp;<br>
Takes practice - same with spiritual laws.</dd>

<div><b><u style="background-color:rgb(252,229,205)">My Home in the Whole</u></b></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><u>Being in synch with the Universe</u></div>
<dl>
<dt><b>Home</b></dt>
<dd>My inner home and outer home are places of tranquility. As love myself, I find myself finding safe and comfortable outer home for myself. I feel at home in my body, my inner home.&nbsp;</dd>
<dt><b>Community</b></dt>
<dd>Community of beings of <i>Planet Earth</i> is connected through spirituality. We, at the soul level, are one.</dd>
<dt><b>Planet Earth</b></dt>
<dd>The earth is a wise and loving mother. She provides us with everything we need. Food, water, air, companionship. There are infinite variety of animals, vegetation, birds, fish, natural wonders. I commit to lovingly take care and improve the quality of life on planet. &gt; gently, calmly pass though without leaving a trace.&nbsp;</dd>

<dl>
<dt><b>Housekeeping</b></dt>
<dd>Cleaning home is synch with cleaning mind. Housework is fun because can toss out garbage (stuff that triggers old beliefs) and dust/polish things that treasure (affirm new beliefs with stuff that triggers them.)</dd>
<dt><b>DNA Family</b></dt>
<dd><u>Family reunions</u>: opportunity to practice tolerance and compassion. Feel blessed for unconditional love from extended family members. Remind myself that in general, people, families, try to do the best with the knowledge and understanding they have. Some “don’t care”, but most do.</dd>
<dt><b>Planetary Healing</b></dt>
<dd>I surround situation with love, positive energy. I bless perpetrators with love and affirm that the part of them where love and compassion dwells, comes to the surface so they too, are healed.</dd>
