<dt>Latvian "<i><b>Dainas</b></i>" are lovely, and this is why I'd like to share them with You!</dt>
<dd>
<i>Dainas</i> are small 4-lined versus originating in ancient Latvia. They are reflections of Natural phenomenon, from the smallest organisms and entities to the largest entities and dimensions. Expand-contract. Each a reflection of each other. Most importantly, the <i>dainas</i> are our human experience here on earth. They are observations of how we interact with all around us. We can enjoy them as entertainment, as we observe others, or we can use them as tools to help ourselves get through the day.&nbsp;</dd>

<dd>Although Latvian language grammar can be difficult, the <i>dainas</i> do not require it, as the relationship among objects are described in <i>daina </i>structure. All that is need is a few hundred words, and intuitive understanding of the stage and cast, as described in my essay <i>Saule Sēta Saites</i> (Sun Fences Connections)</dd>

<dd><i>Dainas</i> are a collection of over million 4-lined verses, which "paint" a "frame" in Nature. A series of frames makes a small "movie" of a situation in Nature.&nbsp;To create our own story, we <b><u>improvise</u></b>, by reflecting what we see in nature, to our own life experience. Then we can use any medium to communicate these series of frames. For example, a tradition national costume "<i>lielvardes</i>" belt, has ancient symbols on it, explaining the wearer's life history. Today we can use an animated comic strip posted online, or we can create a song. After all, the <i>dainas</i> started as an oral tradition...the possibilities are endless.</dd>
<dd>The <i>dainas</i> explain how nature works through the seasons. How we humans naturally react and do things. So although our lifestyle economics are different from when these were first produced, Nature itself is constant, so always relevant.</dd>

<dt><b><span style="color:rgb(7,55,99)">all the world's a stage...</span></b></dt>

<dd>I've summarized the <i>Daina</i> stage with this moniker: <i>Saule-Seta-Saites</i> (see link above). <i>Saule</i> means <b>Sun</b>. <i>Sēta</i> means <b>fences boundaries</b>,<i> Saites</i> means <b>connections</b>. From the Whole universe containing the sun - the sparkling sun entity in us as part of whole - we live in our communities, homes, jurisdictions - the fenced boundaries. Everyday life is about the connections we make within this stage - <i>saites</i>. Connections are made by a cast of characters. Once you understand the stage, and the characters, you are free to create your life stories -connections- by using the original <i>Daina</i> frames, or using the ideas within the frames, to create your own life movies. </dd>

<dd>The ancient original <i>Dainas</i> have many sequences in place already. It is noteworthy, that they are done with light humour, and say a lot with very little. And this is how Nature works. It's straight forward, it's light, it's safe. No matter how off balance and out of touch we become, Nature is constant. This is the powerful, meaningful comfort I find in <i>Dainas</i>, and the improvisations I apply everyday, in living in general, and in creating. </dd>
