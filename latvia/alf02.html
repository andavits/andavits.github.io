<dl>
<dt>
<b>animism</b></dt>
<dd>The Latvian language uses animism. Something is alive when said in the
diminutive. Anything can by animated, from people to chairs to rocks
and air. Animism in the language reinforces the founding principle of
wholeness. Everything is alive, and therefore special in its own way
as it fits into the world. </dd>

<dt><b>anthropomorphism</b></dt>
<dd>The Latvian language uses anthropomorphism. When something is
personified, it is its own identity, and given a name (īpaš vārds).
People have their own names, but so can entities in nature like
light, sun, thunder. All personifications start with capital letter. </dd>

<div style="text-align:center"><b><u>words
related to the sun (saule)</u></b></div>
<dl>
<dt>
sun(<b>saule</b>)
</dt>
<dt>
animated sun (<b>saulīte</b>)</dt>
<dd>This is the definition of life in Latvian folklore. It is the pilot
light inside you. Just as pilot light, can grow huge, or seem to be
off, but while you are living it is on. </dd>

<dt>
personified sun (<b>Saule</b>)</dt>
<dd>
This is the sun personified as a god entity. Our ability to perceive
its light and warmth, often makes it a more tangible and realistic
spiritual device than the believed, imagined God (dievs).
</dd>
<dt>personified light (<b>Gaisma</b>)</dt>
<dd>This is the life aspect of god (dievs), or god itself.</dd>
</dl>

<div style="text-align:center"><b><u>words related to the community</u></b></div>
<dl>
<dt>fence, border (<b>sēta</b>):<br>
</dt>
 
<dd>All property and people within the fence.</dd>
</dl>
<u><b><i>types of fences</i></b></u>
<dl>
<dt>gods fence (<b>dieva sēta</b>):</dt>
<dd>symbol of roof over everything &lt;graphic symbol&gt;</dd>
<dt>castle-fence (<b>pilsēta</b>)</dt>
<dd>i.e. city: Are legal, political entities.</dd>
 

<dt>country-fence (<b>lauku sēta</b>)</dt>
<dd>i.e. farm; house-fence (<b>māju-sēta</b>):
The smaller entities are smaller fractal components off the identical
larger composition. </dd>
<dd> 
<br>
</dd>
<dd><br>
</dd>

<dt>community (<b>biebrība</b>, <b>sabiedrība</b>):</dt>
<dd>Biedrība is a group of people, while sabiedrība is a group of
people working together.</dd>
<dt>homestead (<b>saime</b>):</dt>
<dd>In old days a farm homestead would be an extended family. Since there
are  many family last names, the homestead itself is given a name.
The homestead names have something to do with daily living or nature.
(esp bees (bitītes), embroidery (adumi)) Even today, in Latvia’s
postal system, you can send mail to a person in the “homestead”.
A fictitious address for me could be: Anda Vītola “Ezeros” LV
1111. Thats it. my name, homestead, postal code.  
</dd>
<dt>man of the fence (<b>saimnieks</b>):</dt>
<dd>The man of the house. This is role play ideally played by a male. A
healthy male ensures fenced area is safe, and the house and living
needs are engineered and functioning so that the female nurturing
instinct has best opportunity to succeed.  </dd>

<dt>woman of the fence (<b>saimniece</b>):</dt>
<dd>The woman of the house. This is role play ideally played by a female.
A healthy female has instinctive compulsive caregiving motives, but
needs to be in a safe and functioning environment to do so. </dd>

</dl>


<div style="text-align:center"><b><u>words related to family</u></b></div>
<dl>
<dt>family (<b>ģimene</b>):</dt>
<dd>one family unit. I use a family analogy in latvian folklore to
understand ones psyche or personality. The different parts of the
family represent the different parts of the psyche.</dd>
<dt>well-balanced (<b>saderēta</b>):</dt>
<dd>When a family is well-balanced, it is healthy. Similarly, when a
psyche is well-balanced, it is healthy. </dd>
</dl>
In Latvian language today, people often refer to a member of the family,
not by name, but by relation. For example, if you are calling out to
a brother, you would call him “Brother”  instead of by name, say
“Bob”. <br>
<br>
<b><u><i>the cast of family (ģimene)</i></u></b><br>
These figures are personifications of human psyche. They are not to be
taken literally.<br>
mother (māte), orphan (bārenIte, sēderīte) and sun (saule) are discussed
most in the millions of latvian versus.

<dl>
<dt>mother (<b>māte</b>):</dt>
<dd>Is key in nurturing and hence determining success in ability to grow
healthy. Without a mother nothing can grow properly. Instinctively
mothers are considered kind and caring. Animated dimunitive mother
(māmiņa, māmulīte, mamukiņš...) stresses the importance of  her
life essence through the sun, her animated sun (saulīte). Other
words that often describe a nurturing mother are white (balta), good
(laba), beautiful (skaista), gentle (maiga), loving (mīļa)...</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>orphan (<b>bārenīte</b> , <b>sēderīte</b>):</dt>
<dd>Without a mother. The mother may physically not exist, or the mother
may not behave as one, the nurturing instincts not working. Latvian
folklore regards orphans highly. They are thought of as self-reliant
and hard working, as this is the way they had to grow up. They are
the preferred mating partner, because of those strong personality
characteristics. Latvian folklore are filed with resources for
orphans. Nature (daba) and its spiritual entities give preferential
treatment for orphans. They play the roles of mother and rest of
family. Of course in healthy families and communities everything is
not perfect all the time. Everyone experiences the feelings of an
orphan from time to time. Loneliness, fear, disorientation, despair.
In similar fashion as for orphans, nature and goddesses offer support
in those troubled times. </dd>
<dd>
<br>
</dd>
<dt>servant (<b>kalpone/is</b>):</dt>
<dd>Household run by servants, usually orphans (barenītes)</dd>
<dt>shepherd (<b>ganiņš</b>):</dt>
<dd>Children who are removed from homestead to work. A loving family may
exist, but is not accessible, therefore they feel like orphans
(barenItes)</dd>
<dt>step mother (<b>pamāte</b>):</dt>
<dd>This is the cruel mother. The mother the orphan depends on and is
obligated to be with, is the person the orphan fears the most. </dd>
<dt>step (pa - the prefix)</dt>
<dd>Any character who is difficult is given the prefix
“pa”. For example, </dd>
<dt>a stepdaughter (<b>pameita</b>):</dt>
<dd>could be a spoiled brat, but her corresponding stepmother could be
nice, and therefore given the name “māte” instead of “pamāte”.</dd>
<dd><br>
</dd>
<dt>father (<b>tēvs</b>):</dt>
<dd>Ideally he protects and maintains order of the fence-family. He does
the heavy work (stiepšana) and is well-mannered (laipnība). He is
encouraged to be strong (stiprs) and well-learned and developed, like
a large oak tree (dižozols). Realistically this tends not to happen,
demonstrated by the personified story of the strained relationship
between the sun as wife, and moon as husband. The moon, shines
brightly once a month, and is only half there or not at all the rest
of the time. The sun, on the other hand is consistently shining and
warm, and it is this reliability that is absolutely required for
nurturing good health. This is why the father is of secondary
importance to the mother. A father can increase his importance with
reliability.</dd>
<dd><br>
</dd>
<dt>sister (<b>māsa</b>):</dt>
<dd>Is described as always working, doing house chores, schoolwork,
knitting, field and garden work. She feels responsibility for
everything in her surroundings, and feels that she can make things
better. </dd>

<dt>brother (<b>brālis</b>):</dt>
<dd>When he works, he does good work. He often takes breaks, playing
games, especially provoking sister. He fantasizes of making the world
at large a better place, while his immediate surroundings are not as
important. </dd>
<dd><br>
</dd>
<dt>grandmother (<b>vecmāte</b>):</dt>
<dd>Always nice, patient, huggable and has time for you. Is often
referred to in diminutive (vecmāmiņa) stressing importance of life
essence (saulīte)</dd>
<dt>grandfather (<b>vectēvs</b>):</dt>
<dd>Is nice as well; always able to give practical advice. </dd>
</dl>
Once
again I remind that these are personifications of the psyche, and not
a description of how all brothers, sisters, fathers etc function. I
reality, we all possess a little of everything, and are just weighted
differently.
<dl><dt>overall psyche (<b>es, esma</b>):</dt>
<dd>Many latvian versus refer to “es”. This is not a reference to
personal experience, but the psychological experience as a whole. The
traits of the adult psyche encompass all members of the family. For
example, a real father would definitely have some mother psyche
tenderness, otherwise no one would want to be near him, yet alone
marry him. A real mother would not just watch a child put her hand on
the stove. She would set rules, and get angry if child disobeyed,
which is part of the father psyche. </dd>
</dl>

As a person ages, their personality becomes more rigid. In Latvian
folklore old folks can have either positive or negative connotations:
<dl><dt><i>positive connotations</i>: </dt>
<dd>when an old person is addressed in the diminutive. (sirmīte, vecīte,
vecmāmīte, vectētiņš) They are highly regarded. If a balanced
life was lead, then old people will pass on gifts they received
throughout life, such a material things, knowledge and magic
(burvestība). </dd>
<dt><i>negative connotations</i>:</dt>
<dd> when an old person is described as a bent over, falling object (krupītis).
It describes someone who can’t function. Even young dysfunctional
people can be given a slang name of an old person. </dd>
</dl>
The family (ģimene) describes role play of characters in the psyche.
Latvian folklore also describes the history of some actual homesteads
to help us understand by reflecting their situations to our own.
These are the homesteads of the stars and the nature of earth. 
<br>
<br>

<div style="text-align:center"><u><b>Light, colour, shadows, darkness</b></u><br>
</div>
With white sunlight we see all colours; with dimmed light, the colours are
less saturated; with filtered light, we see smaller range of colours;
without light, there is no colour at all. Latvian folklore uses this
idea to describe the state of ones life and psyche.  <br>
Our personality is a range of all colour lights. The addition of all
colours gives white light. White is the full well-balanced psyche. 

<ul>
<li>white (<b>balts</b>) the colour of light from the sun</li>
<li>white life (<b>baltā&nbsp;dzīve</b>)</li>
<li>balanced (<b>saderēta</b>) “combined to fit”)</li>
<li>beautiful (<b>skaists</b>)
Lithuanian “skaistas” meaning Latvian “skaidrs” (clear)</li>
<li>clear (<b>skaidrs</b>)
something makes sense when it is clear, not foggy. A light shines
best when everything is clear. This idea reflected on ourselves.</li>
<li>harmony and balance (<b>daiļums</b>)
the ability to create this white light which is clear (skaidrs) and
beautiful (skaists)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center"><u><b>Spirtual and shining entities - sometimes referred to as gods and goddesses</b></u><br>
</div>
spiritual entities (<b>dievības</b>)<br>
shining entities (<b>spīdekļi</b>)<br>
<br>
spiritual anthropomorphic homesteads and families:<br>
These are described in the oldest recorded versus, going back 4000 years.<br>
<br>

<b><i><u>1) Sun’s family</u></i></b>
<dl>
<dt>Sun’s family (<b>Saules ģimene</b>):</dt>
<dd>This family is the stars in the sky. Versus describe the Sun’s
father, mother, brother, sisters coming to visit. The Sun herself has
daughters, sons and daughter-in-laws. The household is run by
servants, both male and female. </dd>
<dt>Sun’s daughters (<b>Saules meitas</b>): </dt>
<dd>Are most important. They are the essence of life the is shared with the
universe including earth.</dd>
</dl>

From this structure we see that god’s fence (dieva sēta) goes on
indefinitely. There is no beginning of time and space. Your psyche
(esma) in present is structured as the psyches (esmas) of past, and
the psyches (esmas) of future. <br>
<br>

<b><i><u>2) diev’s homestead</u></i></b>
<dl>
<dt>god’s fence (<b>dieva sēta</b>):</dt>
<dd>This is the sun family (<b>saules
ģimene</b>) and the rest
of the universe, including ourselves. </dd>
<dt>god (<b>dievs</b>):</dt>
<dd>Has no capital letter as it is an entity, not a personification. It
represents the whole.</dd>
<dt>the whole (<b>visuma</b>):
Means god. </dt>
<dt>parts of dievs (<b>dieviņi</b>)is dimunitive plural:</dt>
<dd> The diminutive suggests that every part is
important for health. A whole is comprised of parts, so universe is
described as “parts of the whole.” These parts help us understand
the universe and its resources. </dd>
</dl>


<i>members of the homestead</i><br>
There are 2 main divisions: Suns daughters (Saules meitas) and Gods sons
(Dieva dēli):<br>
Sun (Saule) and her parts represent the life aspects of the universe.
God’s sons (Dieva dēli) represent the stage where all things
happen. They are the tools and working skills required to nurture
life. Here Dievs is a father so is capitalized. Sun (Saule) is
represented by circle; God (Dievs) is represented by triangle. Sun
(Saule) also has 2 other spiritual entities (dievības) names Laima
and Māra. Māra is the spiritual entity of all things on earth.
Mothers (Mātes) are spiritual entities with more specialized roles.
Laima is the spiritual entity of fate. She is able to give good luck,
and helps bring together all parts of god’s whole (dieva visuma).
