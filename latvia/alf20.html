[Joonisfilm most successful children’ films, "Tom and Fluffy", "Lotte", "Ladybird’s Christmas", were well received in Germany, France, Italy, China and Australia. All 3 are anthropomorphic tales, involving dogs and insects. The stories were well realized and simple.]&nbsp; <br>

<b><u>The old language of the Baltic, and its ability to tell children’s stories</u></b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As with Latvian language, the Estonian language has origins from 5000 years. The landscape is bound with the language of the people.<br>
“given the age of both the language and the land, there is a sense of stability or permanence found in Estonia that appears to be absent in, for example North America, where the land is massive, relatively young, and continually abused.” &lt;estonian animation&gt;<br>
“This isn’t to say that (estonian animators) are naive and childlike, but rather that their way of perceiving the world, which is closely bound with a language that is spoken by so few, is different from ‘our’ (western perspective).” &lt;estonian animation&gt;<br>
Specifically, Estonians (and Baltics) use language rooted in landscape, centuries old, while Westerners have “heavy case of historical amnesia”, “ease with Orwellian double-speak”, “are perhaps not fully appreciating, let alone understanding, the refreshing, unfiltered nature of Estonian language and thought.” &lt;estonian animation&gt;<br>

<b><u>Latvian principles in communicating to children</u></b><br>
<b>How things work</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Latvian stories that describe how things work, are done by showing that nature’s balance and interaction work the same, whether you are a person, plant, star, or anything else.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stories describe all elements of nature, as plants, clouds, animals, rocks and of course, people, anthropomorphically. They are all in a sense people, going about their daily business. Grammatically they are referred to in the diminutive (iņš, iņa, ītis, īte suffix). This emphasizes that the being, be it a person, dog, grass blade or chair, has a shining light inside itself, and therefore must be handled with care. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Often the plants and animals directly tell children - listeners - how and why they are doing what they are doing, how they are feeling, and of course inviting the listener to their “home” or “event”.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “Nature” and all its elements often discuss with wonder and interest the “cilvēks” (people). “People” are grown ups, and “nature” joins children as “friends” to try to figure them out. Children are acutely aware that for the most part “people” are not happy. Nature’s elements explain to children that the elements of nature, themselves, are not concerned (neuztraucamies) , are satisfied (apmierināti) and are not sad (nebēdās); while “people” (cilvēks) are upset (uztraucās), unsatisfied (neapmierināti) and sad (bēdigi) because they are no longer “friends” (in balance) with “nature”. “Nature” would then remind children they can always “visit” and be “friends” with “nature”, and often give an example of how to do so. For example, an old oak tree would be delighted if a child came to visit with that acorn it just dropped the other day. i.e. friendship comes from giving...&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>How to negotiate difficult situations</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Story takes viewer on journey, and then back home again (atgriezies). So the viewer is brought back to their own world. The viewer-listener is left feeling calm and confident, as no matter what happened in the fantasy world, it is resolved, nature’s way, by balancing. So the viewer is left feeling that they belong in nature’s world and trust it holistically for support. They feel even more respect, admiration and humbleness towards nature’s charm. It is with that understanding that one can have a peaceful nights sleep, whether child or adult. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In contrast, western viewers are often left with an intended “impression” which can leave audiences&nbsp; frightened, ill and concerned. One feels either angry and afraid, or delusional happiness. The story may show real aspects of the world, but no clues as to how to realistically negotiate it; or the show may be a fantasy world attitude with its fantasy happy endings. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is with relevance to self that viewers appreciate a film. So it is important to “put things back where you found them”. In nature, that means physically, and in spirit. Then, from the calm of one’s own volition, one can determine what to do next. <br>
