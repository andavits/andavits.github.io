<div style="text-align:center"><b><font size="4">When Things are Not Balanced</font></b></div>


<div>To every change there are consequences that range from good to bad. The motive in nature is balance, so the solution to problems is by finding integrated balance within the whole. Latvian folklore is not a fight of good versus bad, but a nurturing and relocating of resources to find a holistic balance. Grey represents things partially balances, while complete unbalance is black. <br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Unbalances can be personified with spooky characters. There is no specific god character or natural phenomenon that exclusively defines bad. many character metaphors are used. What they have in common, is how we can deal with them. They can be scared away, often with loud noises, and they can be outsmarted. So the motive is not to fight to kill the bad. Instead they are to be re-directed, in the belief that they will fit in somewhere else in gods fence (<i>dieva sēta</i>). Some popular characters found in folklore are devil (<i>velns</i>), dragon (<i>pūķis</i>), scrouge (<i>skauģis)</i>, mystic (<i>burvis</i>). <br>
</div>

</div>
<div>In folklore stories, characters are often "falling" into yucky places, such as hell (<i>elle</i>), well (aka), dark corners (<i>kaktiņos</i>). This is meant metaphorically. It is an experience within the psyche. Often we feel "trapped". We feel we have "fallen" into something we do not like. These experiences are often personified to help us understand. But it is a personification of a psyche experience, and not an actual character's history. <br>

<div style="text-align:center"><i><b>Fate (liktenis)</b></i><br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Fate (<i>liktenis</i>) provides us with our environment, good or bad. It is also the consequences of our behaviors. It is fate that determined what we were born into, but it is our own essence which shapes us. <br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Our fate is personified by goddess <i>Laima</i>. Graphically, she is am upside down triangle. The sun pole (<i>sauļotias stubs</i>) described earlier, can be a visual aid to understand how she combines in each living entity. Sun's life is the center, the triangle is gods environment, and fate is <i>Laima</i>, as the upside down triangle. She provides choices. <br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><i>Laima</i> never does anything that makes your life good or bad. It is something or someone else's behavior that causes good or bad. In Latvian folklore, <i>Laima</i> appears in strategic points to help guide to the best possible solution. The best solution is defined as balance within yourself&nbsp; which is balanced within the universe. Clearly, considering our complexity, yet alone all of nature, to find perfect balance, is not realistic. As one changes, something else goes off. Still, overall, it is amazing how stable we are, nature has a very strong balancing instinct, personified by goddess <i>Laima</i>. <br>
