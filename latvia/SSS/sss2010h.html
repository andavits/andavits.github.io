<div style="text-align:center"><b><font size="4">Sun Tree (saules koks)</font></b></div>
<div><br>
</div>

<div>The sun tree (<i>saules koks</i>) is also called life tree (<i>dzīvibas koks</i>). It represents life cycle, from birth to death. Its meaning is related to the ancient sun pole (<i>sauļotais stubs</i>). <br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The sun pole (<i>sauļotais stubs</i>) was popular in ancient architecture. I have two interpretations of its meaning. The first interpretation describes ancient gods. Here, god (<i>dievs</i>) represents the whole infrastructure and is represented with a triangle. A triangle upside down is graphical representation of fate, or personified by <i>Laima</i>. In the center the graphical circle is the sun, representing life as light. Every being is a combination of infrastructure, their fate, and life essence which holds it together. The second interpretation of the sun pole is a specific example, in this case, a tree. The tree's life starts from graphical circle. From their it grows roots into the ground, which support and reflect the branches above the ground. A symmetric opposition. So the stronger the foundations, the stronger the tree.</div>

<div><br>
</div>
<div>Taking the concept of the sun pole as a tree further, you get a sun tree (<i>saules koks</i>). We do not see a tree's roots, just as we do not see a person's roots. The ancient graphic of sun's tree (<i>saules koks</i>) has a small center of life, with branches extending, above ground, in all directions. Just like real trees, they can be graphically simple or complex. A complex branch system has a prefix "<i>diž</i>". <br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In Latvian, the prefix "<i>diž</i>" means largley integrated. This is our goal. All living entities are as sun trees, and our goal is to be integrated sun trees, So for myself, I'd like to become "<i>diž-Anda</i>". Our fate (<i>liktenis</i>) often personified in <i>Laima</i>, helps us build our sun tree (saules koks) within gods fence (<i>dieva seta</i>). Within our own psyche, if we make solid foundations in our brain, our inner reality, then it will transfer to our outer reality.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Animism of the sun tree (<i>saules koks</i>) helps explain personalities and fate, In nature, we see all kinds of trees, in many different circumstances, with different personalities. The following are some common ways that trees are used to describe people, time and events. <br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div style="text-align:center"><b><i>Trees in Nature as Sun Tree (Saules Koks)</i></b></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>1) Trees <u>used by <i>dievini</i></u> when they want to talk to use:</div>
<div><b><i>Liepa</i> (Linden)</b> <i>Laima </i>sits here. In Latvia, the Linden is a generic looking tree. It can grow simply or quite large and complex. <br>
</div>
<div><b><i>Vitols</i> (Willow) </b><i>Māra</i> sits here, In Latvia, a willow grows by calm water, and has silvery leaves with somewhat droopy branches, Earth, water, and consequent growth of tree is symbolic of principles of growth. Its sparkling leaves are symbolic of spiritual growth, Its long waved branches can be seen to comfort you as a mother hugging a child. <br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>2) Trees representing the <u>balanced psych</u>e:</div>
<div><b>White trees - balanced psyche</b></div>
<div><b><i>Ābele</i> (Apple tree)</b>. Its flowers in spring are white, and then they change structure into apples in fall. Means that your white <i>esma</i> (white flower) is best to create a living structure in earth (apple). <br>
</div>
<div><b><i>Bērzs</i> (Birch)</b> In Latvia birches are very tall, straight stemmed trees, hence they symbolize stability. They are white, symbolizing well balance, A birch cluster (<i>berzu brize</i>) is a popular place to go for spiritual comfort. <br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>3) Trees representing <u>growth</u>:</div>
<div><b>Green tree - green is young growth</b></div>
<div><b>Red tree - red is ripe</b>. Is where the sun rises in the morning, representing the beginning of life. A red woman is fertile. Only women can get near red tree because life begins inside them. Young men go to look for red tree, but in vain, turning into old men.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>4) Trees representing <u>time</u>:</div>
<div><b>Oak tree - Leap year</b>: In the story of the sun, Sun (<i>Saule</i>) cries when picking up fallen branches of oak tree that was struck by Thunder (<i>Pērkons</i>) during wedding ceremony. Sun finds the branch from to top on the 4th leap year. <br>
</div>
<div><b>Birch tree - Day cycle</b>: 3 leaves or branches. Representing where sun rises and sets. The middle is used by <i>Dievs</i> or <i>Saule</i> to melt silver. So during the day we can use our sparkling resources to construct things, for better or worse. <br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>5) The <u>complexly integrated <i>dižais</i></u> tree:</div>
<div><b>Ozols (Oak)</b> In Latvia this tree grows very integrated. <br>
</div>
<dl>
<dt><u>A job well done</u>.</dt>
<dd>An oak wreath is presented to someone, male or female, who has done something requiring tenacity and integrated wellness. </dd>

<dt><u>The wise one</u>.</dt>
<dd>An oak tree is very integrated and therefore wise. It is a popular place to go when seeking out answers to life's questions. </dd>

<dt><u>The man tree</u>.</dt>
<dd>A man wants to have many skills to work in a <i>sēta</i>. The oak tree represents a skilled man. Women find oak trees, men, attractive when bees, honey, acorns (<i>zīles</i>), amber and anything yellow like yolk, representing potential procreation, are found in oak trees. The man's fighting instinct can be both constructive and destructive. Thunder (<i>Pērkons</i>) often lashes out at the oak tree, causing much damage, but sometimes in its place there is amber (<i>dzintars</i>) which represents potential new growth for the better. </dd>
