<div style="text-align:center"><font size="4"><u><b>White Life (baltā dzīve)</b></u></font></div>
<div><br>
</div>


<div>The psyche is described as life within a white-fence (<i>baltā sēta</i>). Mental balance is called white light (<i>baltā dzīve</i>). Our goal in our psyche is to get everything withing our mind to fit together (<i>saderēta</i>). As well, our outward behavior is to fit together with the environment.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><b>White (<i>Balta</i>)</b>: Mental health is when all elements of our psyche are fitted together (<i>saderēta</i>). Visually, it is defined as white (<i>balta</i>), which is a combination of all colours in the visual spectrum. Of course, this parallels everything within gods fence (<i>dieva sēta</i>) as well. See diagram. When everything is balanced, we see sparkling shine of white (<i>balta</i>). Common metaphors for the sparkling shine of "<i>balta</i>" (white) are white light, anything that shines or sparkles, silver (<i>sudraba</i>), gold (<i>zelta</i>), leaves smeared with butter. <br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><b>Black</b>: Black is the opposite of white and light. No light, no colour. Black is the metaphor used to describe parts of self and universe that does not fit together. (<i>nav saderēts</i>).</div>
<div>
<div style="display:block;text-align:left"><img src = "images/balta.bmp" border="0"></a></div>
</div>
<div>Your psyche is white (<i>balts</i>) when balanced (<i>saderēta</i>)</div>
<div>Your psyche is black (<i>melns</i>) when not balanced (<i>nav saderēta</i>)</div>
<div>The same principle applies to all within gods fence (<i>dieva sēta</i>)</div>
<div>In the diagram, most is white, with small black spots. So most is balanced, and some spots are not. We can add grey or fogginess to many parts to indicate a somewhat balanced state. <br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div style="text-align:center"><b><i>Balts, Dailums, Skaists, Skaidrs</i></b></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Many metaphors are used to describe balance. Something clear (<i>skaidrs</i>) describes balance. Something makes sense when it is clear, not foggy. A light shines best when it is clear. So too do we and everything around us. In Lithuanian, "<i>skaitas</i>" means Latvian "<i>skaidrs</i>". In Latvian "<i>skaists</i>" means beautiful. White (<i>balts</i>) is the colour of the sun. The sun's light is the source of life, which can multiply to create more life. "<i>Daiļums</i>" is Latvian word to describe harmony and balance. Specifically, one's ability to create this white light which is clear (<i>skaidrs</i>) and therefore beautiful (<i>skaists</i>). <br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div style="text-align:center"><i><b>White Light as Colour Spectrum</b></i></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The coloured light spectrum combined produces&nbsp; white light. Conversely, white light refracted, produces a spectrum of colours. In Latvian folklore, all characteristics of your personality are metaphorically explained as your "spectrum of colours". There is no emphasis on putting a specific trait to a colour. Traits are described in natural order according to the process and approach of a task. One can say loosely that the natural spectrum of colours, defines the natural spectrum of traits. The following are traits considered important in Latvian folklore: <br>
</div>
<div>
<ol><li><b><i>zeme</i> (earth)</b>: We start physically grounded. Foundations have to be strong in order to build a structure. <br>
</li>
<li><b><i>miers</i> (calm)</b>: Only when things are calm, can a seed be planted. The seed will grow into something useful.</li>
<li><b><i>klusums</i> (quiet)</b>: Need quiet to find and admire the light inside yourself (<i>saulīte</i>). It is often lost in noise and busy-ness. The most beautiful people are called "<i>skastākie</i>", implying a beautiful white light. They are people who can hold onto their "<i>saulīte</i>" knowing that no one can steal it. <br>
</li>
<li><b><i>savrupība</i> (self-working)</b>: Self-sufficiency is valued. A "<i>viensētnieks</i>", meaning "one-fenced", is a person that works with their own boundaries, able to appreciate and use what have within own fence. One can share, but not take, from others if needed. <br>
</li>
<li><b><i>spīts</i> (commitment, willpower)</b>: This is your courage to follow through on a plan, even when forced with difficulties. <br>
</li>
<li><b><i>darbs</i> (work)</b>: work ethic is highly valued.</li>
<li><b><i>daiļums</i> (harmony and balance)</b>: The ability to manage the previous colours to create harmony and balance. It is your free-will (<i>liktenis</i>) producing and reflecting (<i>atspoguļo</i>) a natural white life. <br>
</li>
</ol>
