<div style="text-align:center"><b><u>How to define your psyche as components within sēta</u></b><br>
</div>
<b>
</b><br>
In Latvian folklore, it is useful to think of your psyche, or <i>esma</i>, as a family unit (<i>ģimene</i>). The different personalities and roles within a family sēta [fence], are as your own psyche. When everyone lives in harmony within a family structure, all is well. When everything is balanced within your <i>esam</i>, all is well. <br>
<br>
We are all born into a <i>ģimene</i>, albeit rarely all the members of our biological family exist physically, and even if everyone is present, they will never idealistically complete their roles as you depend on them as a child, or as an adult either.<br>
Is this a problem? Not at all. There are 3 solutions:
<ol>
<li>
<u>Rollplay</u>: We can place roles to different people within our family. Maybe your dad actually behaves like a mother, your sister like a dad, and your mother like a <i>pamāte</i>. So what is missing in your spiritual essence of family is your sister and brother. You look to the community to find people to play those roles. If you cannot find anyone there, you look one step up -&gt; #2</li>
<li><u><i>Sēta </i>structure</u>: According to the „<i>sēta</i>” structure, you can always move up a level (<i>lauku sēta</i>, <i>pilsēta</i> – community; <i>Dieva sēta</i>) to get advice and support we need.</li>
<li><u><i>Daba</i> [nature]</u>: The easiest to understand and always accessible: just look out your window. Most <i>dainas</i> compare balance (or unbalance) in nature, to balance (un-balance) in your environment, <i>ģimene</i>, or own <i>esmu</i> [psyche]. So <i>daba</i> can fill in the gaps in your <i>ģimene</i> environment. In folklore, elements of nature are described as sparkling, and therefore are alive (even rocks, mountains..). We are often reminded that this sparkling is directed to us if our free-will is receptive to it. So we are always loved by nature itself.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center"><b><u>Permeable and non-permeable sētas</u></b><br>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Hierarchies with <u>non-permeable</u> sētas (borders) are economic and political structures.</li>
<li>Hierarchies with <u>permeable</u> sētas (borders) are spiritual structures.</li>
</ul>
The Latvian language distinguishes between these two structures:<br>
<dl>
<dt>Example: Vaira Vīķe-Frieberga</dt>
<dd>Vaira Vīķe (maiden name)</dd>
<dd>Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga (name as united with Freiberga sēta)</dd>
<dd>Dr. Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga (scholarly hierarchical name)</dd>
<dd>Presidentes Kundze (political hierarchical name)</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt><u><b>Non-permeable <i>sētas</i> </b>as political hierarchies</u>:</dt>
<dd>In the political non-permeable hierarchy, she is a <i>valdiniece</i> [ruler] in <i>valdība</i> [government] of <i>valsts</i> [country]. Note that Latvian language uses same root to describe associations within the political non-permeable hierarchy. Because this is non-permeable, it needs to be guarded, so no undesirables get in. A job historically for <i>karavīri</i> [war men (warriors)]; but in times of peace, its a job for lawyers. Order within the non-permeable hierarchy is for police (mini-warriors) and lawyers.</dd>
<dt><u><b>Permeable <i>sētas</i> </b>as psycho-social hierarchies</u>:</dt>
<dd>A non-permeable hierarchical social system means that each „<i>sēta</i>” is a separate identity, the same as a permeable hierarchical social system. Within a non-permeable sēta, things are horded, and not shared by default. Sharing is strictly controlled by a select few. That’s why lawyers and warriors are needed to guard the <i>sēta</i>. A permeable <i>sēta</i>, means that things are shared without need for higher consultation. Things are borrowed, not horded. Hence Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga will never be called „<i>Latvijas saimniece</i>” within the realm of politics, but within the realm of our own spiritual world, it could be a valid statement.</dd>
</dl>
To survive in this world on a business basis, we have to conform to the non-permeable sēta as all our political-economic structures are based on this form. To survive in this world as healthy human spirits, it is believed that we are healthiest, and hence most efficacious, when conforming to the permeable sēta.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center"><u>Permeable and non-permeable sētas in Latvian folklore</u>: <br>
</div>
<div>The large bulk of Latvian folklore is about the non-permeable <i>sēta</i> of the human psyche and its interaction with the world.</div>
&nbsp;<br>
There are some war songs and folk epics about war in Latvian folklore as well. These are historically quite new as there are strong references to other cultural and religious symbols of war. They describe the non-permeable <i>sēta</i>, with all its consequential social patterns of heroes, worshiping ideals, ceremonies, awards and monuments. In contrast, none of these social patterns are present in the permeable <i>sēta</i>, describing our psyche. It doesn’t make sense. Your <i>saulīte</i> does not need a reward. It always shines, irregardless.<br>
In summary, older <i>dainas</i> using the permeable sēta, explain war as sad. The men leave, and when they come back, everything has changed. The newer <i>dainas</i> using the non-permeable sēta describe war-heroes. War is celebrated.<br>
<br>
In our daily lives, you will notice that many times people impose idealistic non-permeable sēta around a model of a psyche. This backfires. People usually like the standardized organization of business matters, but don’t try to control their brain.

<br>
<b><u>The cast of <i>ģimene sēta</i> (family)</u></b><br>
These figures are personifications of human psyche. They are not to be taken literally.

<dl>
<dt><i><b>Māte</b></i> [mother]</dt>
<dd>Key. The person you depend on and trust with your life. </dd>
<dd>She is often referred to in diminutive(<i>māmiņa</i>, <i>māmulite</i>, <i>mamukiņš</i>...) as this stresses the importance of her <i>saulīte</i>. </dd>
<dd>Words describing māte: <i>balta</i>, <i>laba</i>, <i>skaista</i>, <i>maiga</i>, <i>mīļa</i>.</dd>
<dd>If you do not have someone in your life who plays the „māte” role, there are problems. It is imperative that you find spiritual resources to replace this gap. If spiritually you do not <i>feel a māte</i> in you life, your pfft. Luckily, the <i>dainas</i> are filled with support.</dd>
<dd><br>
<br>
</dd>

<dt><i><b>Pamāte</b></i> [step mother]</dt>
<dd>This is the mother from hell (so to speak). </dd>
<dd>This is troubling. You are scared of this person you depend on.</dd>
<dt>„<i><b>Pa</b></i>” [step]</dt>
<dd>Any character who is trouble is given the „step” prefix. </dd>
<dd>Example: A stepdaughter (<i>pameita</i>) could be the spoiled brat, but her corresponding stepmother could be very nice, and therefore is given the name „<i>māte</i>”, not „<i>pamāte</i>”.</dd>
<dd><br>
<br>
</dd>

<dt><i><b>Vecmāte</b></i> [old mother (grandmother)]</dt>
<dd>Always nice, patient and able to spend time with you and able to give you a hug. </dd>
<dd>She is often called in diminutive (<i>vecmāmiņa</i>)</dd>
<dt><i><b>Vectēvs</b></i> [old father (grandfather)]</dt>
<dd>Nice person, always able to give you practical advice.</dd>

<dt><b>Old people</b></dt>
<dd><u>Positive connotations</u>:
<ul>
<li>When addressed in diminutive (<i>sirmīte</i>, <i>vecīte</i>, <i>vecmāmīte</i>, <i>vectētiņš</i>...)</li>
<li>Highly regarded.</li>
 
<li>If lead a balanced life, old people will give away all the gifts they received throughout life before they pass on – material, important knowledge, <i>burvestība</i> (magical). Why? In a permeable <i>sēta</i>, all is borrowed, not horded. It is to be used with appreciation, and returned to giver if possible, or passed on.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd><u>Negative connotations</u>:
<ul><li>Addressed as <i>krupis</i>, or other word describing a bent over, falling object.</li>
<li>It describes anyone who can’t function. When dysfunctional, even physically young people could be given a slang name of an old person.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd><br>
<br>
</dd>

<dt><i><b>Tēvs</b></i> [father]</dt>
<dd>The protector of the <i>sēta</i>.</dd>
<dd>Maintains order within <i>sēta</i>. (Does punishments for misbehavior.)</dd>
<dd>Does heavy work (<i>stiepšana</i>) and is well-mannered (<i>laipnība</i>)</dd>
<dd>Names describing <i>tēvs</i>: <i>dižozols</i>, <i>stiprs</i></dd>
<dd><br>
<br>
</dd>

<dt><i><b>Māsa</b></i> [sister]</dt>
<dd>Always working: house chores, schoolwork, knitting, field/garden work.</dd>

<dd><br>
<br>
</dd>

<dt><i><b>Brālis</b></i> [brother]</dt>
<dd>When he works, he does good work.</dd>
<dd>Often taking a break, playing games, especially provoking sister.</dd>
<dd>Fantasize of making the world a better place, while immediate surroundings are not priority.</dd>
<dd><br>
<br>
</dd>

<dt><i><b>Esmu / Es</b></i> [the general psyche]</dt>
<dd>Much <i>dainas</i> refer to „<i>Es</i>” when describing the psyche. i.e. The writer/singer of the song is not referring to personal experience, but to psychological experiences as a whole.</dd>
<dd>The ideal psyche is believed to be one that is balanced: <i>saderēta</i> [everything fits together]. The traits of the adult psyche encompass all members of the „<i>es</i>” <i>ģimene</i>:-<i>māte, tēvs, māsa, brālis, vectēvs, vecmāte </i>– as described above. </dd>
<dd>Example: A real father would definitely have some „<i>māte</i> psyche tenderness” in him, otherwise no one would want to be near him, yet alone marry him. A real mother would not just watch a child put her hand on a hot stove. She would set rules, and get angry is the child disobeyed, which is part of the „<i>tēvs</i> psyche”.</dd>

<dt><b>Es </b>[yourself]</dt>
<dd>Make note of what part of the „ģimene psyche” you already have in your own. </dd>
<dd>(Eg. You may be some brālis, a little māsa and vectēvs)</dd>
<dd>Then fill in the gaps starting with the ones closest to you in your mājas sēta. Then look in to the community sēta, and finally Dieva sēta if you have to.</dd>
<dd>(eg. In the example above, you need a māte, tēvs, vecmāte)</dd>
<dd><br>
<br>
</dd>

<dt><b>Bārenīte</b> [orphan]</dt>
<dd>We all feel like a bārenīte at some point. Loneliness, fear, disorientation, despair. No one to talk with. Latvian folklore regards bārenītes highly. Clearly, being without all resources is stressful and unfair, but it is believed that it is this pain that motivates us to grow as beings. (Although many get caught in self-pity and anger instead). The bārenīte has many spiritual resources, by observing nature, or by moving within the permeable Dieva sēta.</dd>
<dt><b>Kalpone(is)</b> [servant] </dt>
<dd>Household run by servants, which are usually Bārenītes.</dd>
<dt><b>Ganiņš</b> [sheppard]</dt>
<dd>These are children who are removed from family sēta to work. A loving family may exist, but is not accessible, therefore is is psychologically same as bārenīte [orphan].</dd>
</dl>

<u>Summary</u><br>
The ģimene analogy if the psyche is just a learning tool to understand your own personality. Your personality structure, strengths and weaknesses. It gives you&nbsp; solutions on where to go to fill in the gaps, so you are as well-balanced – <i>saderēta</i> – as possible.<br>

<u><b>Cast of <i>Saules Ģimene Sēta</i></b></u> [Sun’s family fence]
<ul><li>
Father, mother, brothers, sisters who come to visit.</li>
<li>Has daughters, son’s, daughter-in-law. Daughters [<i>Saules meitas</i>] are most important.</li>
<li>Household run by servants, both male and female.</li>
</ul>
From this structure we see that the <i>Dieva sēta</i> goes on indefinitely. There is no beginning of time or space. The <i>esma</i> in the present is structured as the <i>esmas </i>of past, and the <i>esmas</i> of the future.<br>
<br>

All these parts of <i>Dievs</i> (<i>dieviņi</i>) help us understand the universe and its resources.<br>
(Explained in detail later.)<br>
<br>

<i><b><u>Saderēšana of Dievs</u></b></i><br>
The 2 main divisions: <i>Saules meitas</i> and <i>Dieva dēli</i>
<ul>
<li><i>Saule</i> and its parts are the essence of life in various forms (represented by circle).</li>
<li><i>Dieva dēli</i> are the tools and working skills required to nurture life (represented by triangle).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The male roles are listed under <i>Dieva dēli</i>. They all have practical work functions.</li>
<li>The female roles are listed under <i>Saule</i>.</li>
<li><i>Saule</i> also has 2 other female entities, <i>Laima</i> and <i>Māra</i>. Māra is the goddess of all things on earth. More specific functions are handled by <i>Mātes</i> [mothers]. <i>Laima </i>is the goddess of luck. She helps bring together all the parts of <i>dieva Visuma</i>.&lt;.li&gt;
</li></ul>
<u><i>Ancient story of sun:</i></u>
<ul>
<li>
Images of the <u>marriage</u> of <i>Saules meitas</i> [sun’s daughters] and <i>Dieva dēli</i> [God’s sons]. (Not to be understood literally; are principles)</li>
<li>Explains our primary motive <u>to grow</u>. To grow, life essence (<i>Saule</i>) has to be nurtured by appropriate work (<i>Dieva dēli</i>). Applies to ourselves and the universe.</li>
<li>Specifically, <i>saules meitas</i> [sun’s daughters] are described as rays of light. They marry <i>Dieva dēli</i> [god’s sons] which are described as workers of the land or other natural phenomenon.</li>
</ul>
<div style="display:block;text-align:left"><img src="images/dievs4.GIF" border="0"></a></div>
This symbol of <i>dievs</i> as a circle over triangle, joined in marriage, yet still identifiable separate. The symbol is ourselves, our relation with loved ones, and how the universe is spiritually structured, This implies that unconditional acts of giving and courage are indeed our own <i>liktenis</i> [free will], as we all have a piece of <i>dievs</i> inside us. Latvians would not say „what an angel” or „he was touched by god”, as there is no separation between humans and gods.<br>
