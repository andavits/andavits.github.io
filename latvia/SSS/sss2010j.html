<div>There are popular saying in Latvia that sum up cultural attitudes founded on the original ancient dainas. "Dzīvo teiksmīgi" means to live as the stories of nature (teiskmas). We are to learn nature so as to find how we can best fit into it. "Pats labs. Visi labs" means that when you are good, then everything is good. If you are not happy with your environment, then you start with yourself and your immediate surroundings. The idea is that if everyone fixes themselves, then collectively everything becomes good. We live from the ground up. It is a "green" cultural attitude. Finally, it is each individual who decides how they fit in best. Not someone else.&nbsp;</div>

Was it god's goodness<br>
Was it sun's whiteness? said in dimunitive<br>

So when you are lost, you go back into yourself, and your original identity, as part of the whole (dievs), and the answer. If your life essence, "saulīte" (sun in dimunitive)
