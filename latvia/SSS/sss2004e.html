<div style="text-align:center"><b><font size="4">Story of Sun [<i>Saules Teiksma</i>]</font></b>
</div>


<br>
The ancient story of the sun is absolutely complete and rich in Latvian folklore. It is approximately 4000 years old, as old as the Latvian language itself. Latvian and Lithuanian are the oldest living languages. They are of Baltic origin, and the original words resemble Sanskrit. These are words about nature, the cosmos, and its personified characters, which we call <i>dieviņi</i>.<br>
The <i>teiksma</i> of the sun is a celestial wedding. <i>Spīdekļi</i> [things that sparkle] in the sky are personified, and their movement and interaction in the sky resembles the struggles and balances in nature. They explain our primary motive to <u>grow</u> where by our life essence (<i>saule</i>) has to be nurtured by appropriate work The story reveals how difficult this is to do.&nbsp; <br>

Ideally, <i>Saules meitas</i> and <i>Dieva dēli </i>become <i>saderēta</i>, and a shining <i>Dieva sēta</i> results.<br>
(<i>Dieva</i> from the ancient word „shining”.)<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align:center"><u><b>Story summary</b></u><br>
</div>
<i>Saule </i>as a maiden and <i>Mēness</i> [moon] as suitor. They court, and <i>Saule</i> becomes wife with <i>Mēness</i>. <i>Saule</i> and <i>Mēness</i> had many offspring, the stars. The marriage is not harmonious. When <i>Mēness</i> misbehaves, <i>Saule</i> scolds him using silver stump, silver pebble or anything that sparkles as part of nature, thereby representing <i>Visuma</i>. Symbolically, <i>Saule</i> believes <i>Mēness</i> is not in balance with <i>Visuma</i> [the whole]. When <i>Mēness</i> is adulterous, <i>Saule</i> uses a sharp sword. Symbolically using the sword, she hurts him with something he made himself. <br>
In daily life, <i>Saules Meitas</i> [daughters of sun] apparel and activities are described. They are often joined by <i>Dieva Dēli</i> [son’s of god]. As explained in sēta ģimeme, these are <i>dieviņi</i>, and are not exclusively separate identities. <br>
In springtime, <i>Dieva dēli</i> look for future brides – <i>Saules meitas</i>. The suitors of <i>Saules meitas</i> can be any <i>Dieva dēli</i> like <i>Auseklis</i> [morning star], <i>Pērkons</i> [thunder], <i>Ūsiņš</i>, <i>Mēness</i> [moon] or human lad. (<i>Mēness</i> is being adulterous, no incest is implicated). A marriage agreement is made with relatives from both parties present. The wedding is in the fall and is very extravagant and detailed. The relatives of <i>Dieva dēli</i> sing songs of joy, while relatives of&nbsp; <i>Saules meitas</i>, sing songs of sorrow and loss.<br>
After the wedding, <i>Saule</i> is sorrowful. This coincides with nature’s shortened days and overcast skies. <i>Saule</i> is sad because she misses daughter, regrets loss of dowry, but most important, she fears <i>Saules meita</i> in extreme danger, either drowned or dead. <i>Saule</i> sheds tears which are red berries, found in far away places, like across river, other side of mountain, or middle of sea. (Red represents biological fertility). <i>Saule</i> sheds tears at losses. Loss of golden apple (representing spirit of life), silver boat or damaged carriage (representing spirit of constructive work). She cries when a green leaf is torn off a tree from the wind (representing difficulties growing within natures balance) and silk sheets drenched by the rain (representing hard work that goes for not).<br>
