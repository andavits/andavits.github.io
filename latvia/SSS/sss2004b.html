<dd>Personification of <i>saule</i>, or <i>saule</i> as god itself. Our ability to perceive it physically (light and warmth), often makes it a tangible and more realistic spiritual device than the believed, imagined, <i>Dievs</i> [god].</dd>

</div>
<u>
</u><br>
In Latvian folklore, <i>saule</i> is the entity that holds all its parts together. Its description is complete and rich. It is described in the same manner, when explaining metaphysical phenomenon (<i>pasaule</i> [earth], <i>aizsaule</i> [behind-sun. Means afterlife], spiritual phenomenon (<i>gaisma</i> [light] as life essence], emotional phenomenon (warmth, and personified <i>saule</i>), mythological phenomenon (<i>Saule</i>, <i>Saules meitas</i> and <i>Dieva dēli</i>), and its everyday practical physical essence. Context determines which <i>saule</i> is discussed; but you can interpret any/all dimensions as you see fit. <br>
<br>
<u><i>Saule</i> as light = life</u><br>
<br>
In describing a being, the essence of life is at the core. It is a bright shining light. This definition of <i>saule</i>, is also called <i>saulīte</i>. (We will discuss other aspects of <i>saule</i> later).<br>
<br>
<u>Finding your <i>saulīte</i></u><br>
<dl>
<dt><b><i>Es saderēju ar sauli</i></b>. [I fit together with the sun]</dt>
<dd>This is the adult challenge. We lose site of our <i>sauli</i> as we naturally build defensive walls around us during difficult times. In our heroic efforts building these walls around our most precious self – our <i>dvēsele</i> and feelings – we always forget to make a door for us to get in ourselves. Many lose sight of what this <i>saulīte</i> is altogether. We instinctively know that there is something inside us vitally important, and spend enormous effort protecting it, but totally forgetting to just visit it. (As an analogy, have you ever been invited to dinner, where you are sat down, and the host(ess) is frantically getting you drinks, food and fussing over every little detail of presentation. There you are all alone through the whole dinner saying to yourself, I wish s/he would just talk with me...Our <i>saulīte</i> often feels the same way.)&nbsp;&nbsp; </dd>
<dt>
<b><i>Turi Tavu saulīti klēpītī </i></b>[hold your sun (diminutive) in you lap]</dt>
<dd>This reminds us to do everything from the light that shines brightly inside us. Its location physically seems to be around you lap, where you would hold a song book, or put your hands together in spiritual practice. Folklore is filled with ideas of how to find it, what it feels like, and why it is important. It’s a matter of personal preference which little verse(s) would work best for you. </dd>
</dl>
<u>What your <i>saulīte</i> feels like</u><br>
<br>
When <i>saulīte</i> is found, you are content. There are no emotions, so you have no needs or fears. You feel integrity as yourself as a part of the whole, in your intimate surroundings and beyond. There is an as-a-matter-of-factness and charm in your disposition. As is evident in the demeanor of participants in Latvia’s many massed choirs. It is a place of loving kindness, sincerity, and clarity.<br>
