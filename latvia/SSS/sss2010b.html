<div style="text-align:center"><font size="4"><b><u>Sun (<i>saule</i>)</u></b></font></div>
<div><br>
</div>

<div>The sun (<i>saule</i>) is the entity that holds everything together. She is multifaceted. Of the millions of <i>daina</i> verses, the sun has the most. Her description is rich and complete. <br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The sun has various names, depending on what she is doing. Sun (<i>saule</i>) is the sun we see in the sky. When said in the diminutive (<i>saulīte</i>), it suggests its owner is shining from inside. This means that the entity is alive, and therefore is special and requires special handling. The sun personified (<i>Saule</i>) is written with capital letter. This identifies the sun as a spiritual entity, god or goddess. Our ability to physically perceive the sun's light and warmth, often make it a more realistic spiritual device that other god figures that are experienced in the mind only. Light from the sun personified (<i>Gaisma</i>) is the spirit of light and therefore life. The sun as a physical entity helps describe feelings such as emotional 'warmth' or a 'bright' outlook. <br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The most important thing about the sun is that it gives light, which in Latvian folklore is the essence of life. This important aspect is emphasized when the sun is described in the diminutive (<i>saulīte</i>) or anything said in the diminutive. <br>

<div style="text-align:center"><b><u>Popular motives related to the sun</u></b></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><b>I fit together with the sun </b><i>( Es saderēju as saulīti) </i>:</div>
<div>The essence of our shining light inside, is understood when born, but is often lost in adults. Adults need to remind themselves where it is. Some adults have lost their ability to find it altogether, but it is always there, as a pilot light, whether one consciously notices it or not. Folklore is filled with ideas of how to find it, what it feels like, and why it is important. It's a matter of preference which versus work for you. <br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><b>Hold the sun in your lap</b><i> ( tuŗi saulīti klēpītī </i>):</div>
<div>This saying reminds us to do everything from the shining light that shines inside us. Its location physically seems to be around your lap, where you hold a song book, or put your hands together in spiritual practice, the forth chakra. When holding the sun, there is an as-a-matter-of-factness and charm in one's disposition, much as a young child's. This is evident in the demeanor of participants in Latvia's many massed choirs. <br>
