</div>


<br>
To every change there are consequences – good and bad. The motive of nature is balance. Considering the complexity of ourselves, yet alone all of nature, it is amazing how stable we are. Still, as variables shift to balance, others become unbalanced, and vice versa. In everyday language we explain change as balance of risks-benefits.<br>
<br>
<u>Things always go wrong – much still a mystery:</u><br>
Sometimes we don’t understand what the imbalances are, and sometimes we have a partial understanding. In Latvian folklore, unbalances in psycho-social makeup are „black”, and often are personified by spooky characters. There is no fight of good versus evil, black versus white. Instead, these variables are scared away, by making loud noises, or outsmarted.<br>

<div><b><i>Laima</i></b> and <b><i>liktenis</i></b> (fate): <br>
</div>
<div>Life can be miserable, and sometimes it is 
<i>Laima </i>(the goddess of fate), that put us there – <i>Laimas liktenis</i>. (Ex. 
Born into a bad situation). But most often, it is our own behaviour, our
 <i>liktenis</i>, that creates our own, and the world’s misery. </div>

<dt>The bad guys:</dt>
<dd>The consequence, is a plethora of troublemaker characters, both imaginary and real. Some describe the irrational demons in our minds, while others describe real problems in our life. *** Note, that these are not characters that <i>Dievs</i> introduced to us (<i>dieviņi</i>). These are parts of the universe not well balanced.</dd>
 
<dd>We have to deal with unbalances every day. The <i>dieviņi </i>can help us, if we choose. It is our own free will (<i>liktenis</i>) to choose how to live with the <i>Dieva sēta</i>. The <i>dieviņi</i> do not advocate fighting or changing the imbalance to create an idealistic whole; instead, they teach us how to avoid them and push them aside – they are not welcome. </dd>

<dt>The bad places:</dt>
<dd>Often we feel trapped. We feel we have „fallen” into someplace we don’t like or want to be. The task of survival, and escape is exhausting.</dd>
<dd>In folklore stories characters are always „falling” into yucky places. <b><i>Ellē</i></b>, <b><i>Akā</i></b>, <b><i>tumšos kaktiņos</i></b>. [hell, well, dark little rooms]</dd>

<br>
</dd>

<dt>The good guys</dt>
<dd>Some supernatural and unexplained can be good as well. These characters usually are female. This is because female characters in <i>Dieva sēta</i> represent life, which by default is good; while male characters represent work. Work can be well done or poorly done.</dd>
<dd>Newer folklore may have female witches as bad, influenced by other cultures)</dd>
