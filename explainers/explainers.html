<dd>To figure out what kind of transaction works best in a situation, first define what the person’s final goal is: 
<ul><li><b>narcissists</b> want <u><i>narcissistic supply</i></u> (they are NOT interested in solving the solution; instead, they use situations to get narcissistic supply)</li>
<li><b>selfish</b> people want <u><i>their own way</i></u> (they are interested in a solution that helps themselves at the expense of everything else)</li>
<li><b>normal</b> people want <u><i>solutions</i></u> (they are interested in solutions that trigger overall balance and hence growth)</li></ul>

<dt>It <u>is not</u> necessary to formally diagnose people that we  interact with (that’s for the professionals).</dt>
<dd>It <u>is</u> necessary to understand the PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOUR and the INTENSITY ON A SCALE of each of the patterns, to figure out the best way to interact. </dd>

<dt>Some transactions and experiences are brutal, which trigger huge, deep emotions.</dt>
<dd>The subtle messages passed to us by our elders growing up are the most damaging to us as adults now. Take the time to understand what happened; then there is more success in realigning our current emotions.

Learning something, means you are a <b>teacher</b> to yourself. Learning is about making <b>connections</b>.

<dd>My studies in science of psychology, had a direct positive feedback loop in my own success as a student. Specifically, I applied to myself, the learning models from the point-of-view of how the brain functions. Then I applied these models to sport - so physical movement - with great success. </dd>
<dd>
	Clearly, this scientific information was useful in practical things, so I instinctively wanted to share this knowledge. The problem was that scientific explanations are jargon to the average user without that background. That was my motive to put together teaching manuals to help people teach themselves, without the scientific jargon attached.</dd> 
<dd>
For due diligence, links to original university studies, that link back to the science, can be found in this site. Everything is connected in science, and connection is the founding principle of learning. </dd>
