<dd>To figure out what kind of transaction works best in a situation, first define what the person’s final goal is: 
<ul><li><b>narcissists</b> want <u><i>narcissistic supply</i></u> (they are NOT interested in solving the solution; instead, they use situations to get narcissistic supply)</li>
<li><b>selfish</b> people want <u><i>their own way</i></u> (they are interested in a solution that helps themselves at the expense of everything else)</li>
<li><b>normal</b> people want <u><i>solutions</i></u> (they are interested in solutions that trigger overall balance and hence growth)</li></ul>

<dt>It <u>is not</u> necessary to formally diagnose people that we  interact with (that’s for the professionals).</dt>
<dd>It <u>is</u> necessary to understand the PATTERNS OF BEHAVIOUR and the INTENSITY ON A SCALE of each of the patterns, to figure out the best way to interact. </dd>

<dt>Some transactions and experiences are brutal, which trigger huge, deep emotions.</dt>
<dd>The subtle messages passed to us by our elders growing up are the most damaging to us as adults now. Take the time to understand what happened; then there is more success in realigning our current emotions.

Learning something, means you are a <b>teacher</b> to yourself. Learning is about making <b>connections</b>. 


<dl>
<dt><span style="color:rgb(106,168,79)"><b>TEACHING - LEARNING PLATFORMS</b></span></dt>
<dd><b>Self-Directed Coaching Program</b>: My studies in science of psychology, had a direct positive feedback loop in my own success as a student. Specifically, I applied to myself, the learning models from the point-of-view of how the brain functions. Then I applied these models to sport - so physical movement - with great success. <br>
	Clearly, this scientific information was useful in practical things, so I instinctively wanted to share this knowledge. The problem was that scientific explanations are jargon to the average user without that background. That was my motive to put together teaching manuals to help people teach themselves, without the scientific jargon attached.<br> 
For due diligence, links to original university studies, that link back to the science, can be found in this site. Everything is connected in science, and connection is the founding principle of learning.

<dd>Wilfrid Laurier University Stydy skills (from 1990s)
<ul><li>These are tips to learn materials for tests and how to conduct tests. It is a ‘gulp and barf’ approach, that is not concerned in creating long term meaningfully stored learned content.
     </li></ul></dd>
<dd>The Second Brain (today)
<ul><li>Digital note taking and storage systems. These systems focus on creating connections that have meaning, and have a foundation to connect too, so they can be retrieved long into the future. We consider our ‘future me’ in all decisions on what to learn next. <br>
	There are 3 pillars, approaches, to use. The first 2 are foundational skeletons that we create in our brains to attach information too. The first is like a table of contents in a textbook. It categorises information as we would see in a library. The second is systems diagrams, that shows us how things move and change over time, or how a structure works. The third pillar is from the bottom up, much like taking data and trying to find a pattern in it. A slip-box method using index cards which have a  summation of the gist of a concept written on them. Although the method is simple, to actually use it in a useful way, requires some reading and regrouping in our learning methodologies. <br>
	I would then add a fourth pillar for note-taking. I use the symbology of writing computer algorithms to that of note-taking. I was never a good writer, but am good at logic, so I take notes by re-writing ideas using IF-THEN statements, functional groupings, and recursives. This creates a consistent design in learning details to hang on my foundational structures.<br>
	<br>
	This online library is my second brain. It started out in a non-digital form, back in university days in the nineties. I created it based on the science of learning I was studying.
