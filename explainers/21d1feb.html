<div>Links about Latvia security, NATO eastern front, Russia, America and Trump. In the end, this month we see NATO working well together, including the American army, we see Russia continuing using the same tactics as usual, increasing activities in more offensive manner. Unfortunately, President Trump often contradicts plans and principles of American army. Is he "compromised"? Is he a malignant narcissist with no ability fro empathy? Is he both?&nbsp;</div>

<dt>What to do when confronted with a political narcissist - tips circulating on social media in America:</dt>
<dd>Your health is important. Breathe. Fill you body with healthy food. Exercise. Sleep. Be brilliant in your line of work. Use your talents. Love, love a lot, AND be kind.<br>

When you are ready to tackle your mission
<ol>
<li>Don't use his name.</li>

<li>Remember this is a regime and he's not acting alone.</li>


<li>Make five calls a day. (Fax or emails work too, but not as well as calls.)</li>

<li>Do not argue with those who support him; it doesn't work - and it wastes your time/energy/attention. Try to look for any common ground - a morsel of something you can agree on and celebrate the baby steps toward healing our divided nation.</li>

<li>Focus on his policies</li>

<li>Keep your message positive; they want the country to be angry and fearful because this is the soil from which their darkest policies will grow.</li>

<li>No more helpless/hopeless talk.</li>

<li>Support artists and the arts.</li>

<li>Be careful not to spread fake news. Check it.</li>

<li>Take care of yourselves and each other.</li>

<li>Resist! Use non-violent, peaceful language and behavior.</li>

<li>Praise and thank those folks who are doing the good work.</li>

<dd>When we move politics from center left or center right to extreme left or right, we no longer function as democracy. Getting rid of "administration" means that it gets replaced by a dictatorship. That is how Nature works. Democracy is owned by everyone. It does not have a master king in charge. The fallacy that some people believe is that all we need is a Savior, to be master of all rules, and all will be well. God is not a fairy godmother, it does not work that way.</dd>

<b><i><font style="background-color:rgb(255,255,0)" color="#38761d">Military </font>-&nbsp;</i></b><br>
Peacekeeping military front in Latvia is being replaced by a "deterrent" front, responding to threats of Russian Kremlin invading Latvia and Baltic neighbors:

<dl>
<dt>Deterrent troops arrive in Europe Baltics. Some work alongside NATO, some within NATO and some do both. Canada, that provides peacekeeping support, is now scheduled to be deployed later in June as part of the deterrent&nbsp;mission, which seems to be lead by the Americans and is called "Atlantic Response". As is always in army strategies, as regular people we will never know all the details.</dt>
<dd><br>
</dd>

<dt>Russia has been bullying the Baltic countries, breaching international territories with military equipment, cyber attacks and propaganda gaslighting attacks. After a long silence since the cold war, it surfaced again summer 2014 in Baltics. By 2016 it was a part of normal life again. Still, it was all fear mongering. That changed in fall of 2016 when the strategy of Russia to take over 5 countries in Europe starting with Latvia was revealed. It would see a tank invasion that would be able to take Riga in 60 hours, then a freeze state of 60 hours, and then a Nato response, which could very well lead to a nuclear war. Then Donald Trump was elected as America president who presents himself as pro-Russian, anti-Nato, which is completely contrary to American army, European and world allies. Very confusing. Worst, Russia continues to build up its arsenal which now is capable to overtake Europe.</dt>
