<div style="text-align:center"><i>why narcissistic abuse feels different than other forms of emotional trauma</i></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<dl>
<dt>Narcissistic abuse - not just emotional damage, but <b>spiritual damage</b></dt>
<dd>because deliberately inflicted by someone you love </dd>
<dd>targets you for who you are - the very ESSENCE of you </dd>
<dt>It is a long-term, calculated campaign to</dt>
<dd>make you feel unworthy and despise yourself</dd>
<dd>have you believe that others view you in the same light </dd>
<dd><br>
</dd>

<dt>Muggings, car crashes, earthquakes - are traumatic, happen randomly AND have <u>nothing</u> to do with the person you are</dt>
<dt>Narcissistic abuse - calculated focus - like laser beam - on just 1 dimension of your psyche</dt>
<dd>Wants you to believe 
<ul><li>No one cares about you </li>
    <li>AND no one should care about you 
    </li>
<li>BECAUSE you, as a person, are not loving | have no redeemable&lt; qualities | are waste of time &amp; money </li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dd>Does by: learns your hopes, dreams, fears, painful memories 
<ul><li>→ turns them against you to weaken your spirit | to more compliant w/narcissist’s wishes </li>
 <li>Takes advantage of your forgiving personality&nbsp;
<ul><li> → repeatedly exploits your fear of abandonment to
<ul><li>Make you more dependent on them </li>
     <li>More likely to stay attracted to them despite (or because of) the misery you find self in&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</dd>
 
<dt>Traumatic events: devastated - but come out renewed source of love, light</dt>
<dd>Because don't devastated your feelings &amp; self-worth → they don't crush your spirit </dd>
<dt>vs - narc abuse: soul-crushing</dt>
<dd>→ therefore trauma feels different &amp; more difficult to overcome (ie. we are feeling so utterly helpless/hopeless in our spirit) </dd>
<dd><br>
</dd>


<dt>Only hope for victim of narcissist abuse: make clean split from source of spiritual journey</dt>
<dt>Counselors/therapists PhDs - trying to fix narc relationships → only&nbsp;</dt>
<dd>Increase narcissistic epidemic </dd>
<dd>Increase emotional suffering to targets </dd>
<dd>Increase indirect effects of victim’s families &amp; wider community </dd>

<dd>They sympathize with <i>narcissists</i>
<ul>
<li>View them like wounded individuals (rather than cruel, sadistic, tormentors they really are)</li>
 
<li>Narcissists may have been wounded as children (that's unfortunate) → but child is long gone 
 
<ul><li>→ leaving an adult with&nbsp; 
       
<ul><li>Underdeveloped level of emotional maturity </li>
        <li>Non-existent emotional intelligence </li>
        <li>Deficient attachment capabilities </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Therefore left in child’s palace - is scheming manipulator who doesn't care about anyone else but themselves </li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd><br>
</dd>
<dd>

<br>
</dd>
<dt>therefore, in conclusion:</dt>
<dd>DON'T focus on narcissist</dd>
<dd>DO focus of healing damage narcs have done to our spirits, &amp; chaos they have brought into our lives</dd>
