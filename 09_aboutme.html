<div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:rgb(11,83,148)"><b>--- HOW I GOT HERE - MY CAREER STORYLINE ---</b></span></div>
<p>I am a retired developer, now focused on computation statistical data analysis. In the broad field of data science, my focus is on statistical analysis of social and psychological behaviour, which is relevant anywhere humans are involved in all industries. This is something that I always have wanted to do in my career; so when the R programming language became mainstream as a statistical programming language, along with the advances in computing power, it was time to relearn and upgrade my statistical skills and do this. No more excuses! Now here I am - able - and am pursuing this for at least 10 more years. </p>

<p>I have ongoing hobbies that sometimes have been my primary income. What I learned from those experiences is that with regards to creative activities, it is best to keep them as hobbies. Creativity is my life-force, so the focus of the end result, instead of the journey getting there, was not good for my soul.</p>

<p>Statistical data analysis is problem solving, which is creative, but in a different way. Being on a team of problem solvers using peer-reviewed and accepted scientific methods employing collective shared intelligence spanning centuries is mindblowing. The science of data is a zen environment to work in, in that the knowledge changes in a gradual organic way, without sudden surprises. It then leaves me to sort through all the industry and government collected data I am analysing to see patterns among real and lurking variables, feeling confident that the tools to do this are robust.</p>

<div style="text-align:center"><span style="color:rgb(11,83,148)"><img src="images/customLogo.gif" border="0"><b>--- ABOUT MY LOGO ---</b></span></div>

<p>I created this copyrighted logo in 1996. The graphics of the logo superimposes stylized Olympic and Psychology symbols, combining my target audience, Olympic athletes, and the cognitive behavioural sciences. Graphically, there is an intentional optical illusion in it, exaggerated by the saturated contrasting colours. For that reason, our brains make it jiggle a bit, so even though it is a static image, it feels animated to us.</p>

<p>I made this logo for a manual I wrote to help high-end athletes use science-based motor learning tools. My goal was to teach complicated learning methods in an easy-to understand and practical way. I aimed for these elite athletes to become <i>self-directed coaches</i>, while their hired coaches take the role of technical assistants and motivators. Today this is how it usually works, so a lot has been learned by elite athletes over these decades.</p>
 
<p>When I graduated with a degree in behavioural sciences, I was thrilled with the way the science-based community works, yet distressed that none of that information was accurately, effectively communicated to the general public. It still is not. So I am continuing to use the logo, but this time, I am the one striving for excellence. Today my goal is to teach complicated human data in a practical, useful way to the end users. To call out the lurking variables of the data world and replace them with the Olympic spirit of excellence in our use of data.</p>
