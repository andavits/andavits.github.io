<BLOCKQUOTE id=para1 style="display:none">
Our defining rhythms – our oratorio. An oratorio is a life story explained musically using rhythm and emphasis. This life-beat can be of a person, relationship, or community. <u>Suspense</u>, <u>climax</u> and <u>denouement</u> cycle continuously to unique timing and power. Every person has a unique rhythmic pattern, or life beat.<br>
<b>Rhythms in fine art, music and sport.</b><br>
The <i>process of</i> <i><u>consuming</u></i> entertainment, be it art, music or sport, requires that we experience suspense, followed by a climax and finally a denouement, to fully appreciate its reality. For example, take the process of listening to a piece of music, versus the process of viewing a piece of artwork. Usually people give more consideration and praise to a piece of music because they listen to the whole piece. They may not appreciate art because they do not look at it long enough to understand the whole story. When listening to music, the composer, conductor and player determine the time frame for different elements. A specific rhythm is set and certain points are emphasized. The audience gets the full story (as long as they sit through the whole piece.) When art work is looked over, the viewer sets the time frame for how the different elements are experienced. If it is a still piece, all the elements are looked over at once. The viewer may get overwhelmed and glance for only a few seconds. If the viewer stops and searches below the surface of art, s/he will find the elements of suspense, climax and denouement. To do this, the viewer must take enough time to give the art full consideration.<br>
The <i>process of</i> <i><u>creating and performing</u></i> music follows the same cycle of suspense, climax and denouement. In a music performance, the musician starts by experiencing physical  suspense or anxiety, especially when s/he first gets up in front of the audience. The climax in the performance is when the musician feels free and confident, getting totally lost in the music. Finally there is the denouement when the musician focuses on finishing the piece. The musician is tired and proud when this goal is reached. This is very similar to the experience an athlete experiences in a tournament. There is pre-competitive anxiety (suspense), which dissipates as the athlete gets absorbed in the competition (climax). Then a denouement occurs. The athlete sees the finish line and must stay disciplined to stay focused right to the end. When this goal is reached, the athlete is physically and mentally exhausted but with a deep sence of accomplishment. The creative process in art follows the same sequence. The artist experiences suspense when trying to find an idea. Once the idea is found, the artist can just go with it (climax) until the composition is finished (denouement).<br>
This repetition of feelings of suspense, climax and denouement, gives rhythm to the musicians, artists, or athlete’s total existence. This existence is idiosyncratic, making everyone unique, and hence special. There are people who choose to develop their total existence by living vicariously through others, like artists and athletes. But no matter how it is done, everyone has his or her own life oratorio.<br>
<b>Different oratorios</b><br>
So why do some people become doers and others become watchers? Personal rhythms are, of course, influenced by larger rhythms in family and community dynamics; but the strongest influence is the individual him/herself. All people have a fundamental capacity to create, as it is required for survival. The more that is experienced and created, the more integrated a person’s oratorio.<br>
However, some people are indifferent to the potentially novel, and hence the creative process. A person may perceive to have all the answers already. There may be no curiosity, no alarm and no need to try to find answers. The person has succumbed, blindingly and unquestioningly, to the <i>beat</i> of society: a small tooth in the large system of gears moving around and around… until it wears down… and falls off. The tooth is replaced. End of story. But how can one live like that? For many people, not knowing all of life’s answers causes fear and anxiety (suspense): perhaps falling allegros, trills, and quiet daunting eddies could pull you off the beaten path altogether. The mono-rhythmic grind of societal gears provides security and comfort. These people rationalize that the maestro is capable and right; and a good musician <u>always</u> does as the maestro indicates -– from beginning…to the end.<br>
<b>&quot;Full Circle&quot;</b><br>
My poem &quot;Full Circle&quot; talks of the suspense, climax and denouement our <u>survival instinct </u>experiences. This poem is superimposed on a fractal image. A fractal is a group of lines. Smaller fractals produce larger fractals, just as the smaller beats in our lives compose our whole life existence. A small fractal of life may be viewing a piece of artwork, listening to a piece of music, or competing in a tournament. The richer these smaller beats, or fractals, of life, the more integrated and unique we become. The more unique our building blocks, the more that can be done with them – good and bad. It is our oratorio.<br>

ABOUT:<br>
In a dystopian world without kindness, a young girl is born into a family and community that are unwilling and perhaps unable to provide the simple safety net that all children need: unconditional positive regard. She is the sacrificial lamb, the slave, and is severely punished when referring to herself or being proud of her own accomplishments. She is expected to be everything and nothing at the same time. Through a series of poems, we witness her soul and life force dissolve.

"Sunbeam! Sweet baby girl sunbeam," her granddad excitedly exclaims, and all family and friends are delighted... for the wrong reasons.<br><br>

"We will call her Guna - guna means fire, a lifeforce... OUR lifeforce," exclaim family and relatives. Granddad is immediately concerned, "She is a beautiful loving sunbeam, a lifeforce. She is not OURS."<br><br>

"What are you talking about? She is OUR child. OUR lifeforce. She belongs to US." Granddad realizes that this gift from the universe was not going to work. Devastated, he passes on, waiting for her back on the other side. He loved her soul so much, but she would never be allowed to be her truth while in this particular earth body.<br><br>

Guna instinctively knew of her granddad, even though nobody talked about him. She started a collection of poems, which she called "Before He Came," not knowing who "he" was or why that would be important. This is that collection of poems.
