War is when everything is in <b>size extra large</b>. It starts with boundaries. A man made concept.<br>

I was born with an intuitive understanding that the world will not cave in on me...and then lost it growing up... and spent my middle-aged years "<b style="background-color:rgb(255,255,0)">going back</b>" to my initial intuitive understanding.<br>
<br>
Boundaries had grown all around me. <br>
Boundaries I created myself, surrounded my inner light. My personal war.<br>
Boundaries others made around me. Injustices - outer wars.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
I learned that boundaries simply dissolve with love. <br>
