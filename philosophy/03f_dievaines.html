Journal - "Dievaines. Our Light Source"
<hr>
<br>
"Dievaines" is a birthday song for Riga's 810th birthday. (Riga is in Latvia, Europe.) It was sung in a large outside stadium park in Riga, by a large traditional, 7000 plus member choir. The song is an improvisation of some of the oldest Baltic ideas, made practical for us today. <br>

Specifically, this song is called "goddesses", who are Nature's and Universe's entities carrying life energy in the form of light. The first half of the song is about bringing in the Universal light energy and wrapping it around ourselves in "silvery sparkling blanket." This is our aura. Today there are many meditations available to help us bring in this universal light energy. <br>
<br>
Now as this shining entity, we can work. This is what the second half of the song is about. Work does not necessarily mean career. It means doing. The close-ups of individual choir members as they sing this part, shows their own interpretation of work. There is a girl, who seems to have a strong nurturing motive. There is a middle-aged man who seems to be content with routine work, and the choir master is encouraging higher goals. We can also use this light energy to heal and grow ourselves. The point is, however we use it, it will be overall good, because the light energy is from the One source.<br>
<br>
For Riga, which turned 810 this year, 2011, it is believed that it continues to be so vibrant because of the individuals glowing within Riga. Collectively we can imagine the whole city giving off a shining light, and the life-force from the light, keeps the city moving and alive.&nbsp; <br>
