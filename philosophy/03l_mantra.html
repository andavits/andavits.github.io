<div><b><span style="color:rgb(102,0,0)">Quadrivium</span></b>: the original academic approach to understanding natural phenomenon.<br>

"<span style="color:rgb(7,55,99)">Our soul, which is proven to be immortal by Socrates in the <i>Phaedo</i>,
 comes from a position of complex knowledge prior to being born into the
 body. Re-membering - the point of education - literally means putting 
the separate members back into a wholeness. The goal of studying these 
subjects was to climb back (up) to Unity through simplification based on
 the understanding gained by engaging in each area of the Quadrivium. 
The goal lay in finding their <i>source</i> (traditionally this was the sole purpose for knowledge).</span>"<br>
<font size="1">&lt;<i><u>Quadrivium: the four classic liberal arts of number, geometry, music, &amp; cosmology</u>. Walker &amp; Company, 2010, New York</i>&gt;</font><br>
This
 was from the forward. I find this book extremely inspiring and 
interesting. I read it often as it is easy to apply to creative ideas. <br>

Here's how the forward begins:<br>
"<span style="color:rgb(7,55,99)">The
 Quadrivium was first formulated and taught by Pythagorus as the 
Tetraktys around 500 BC, in a community where all were equal, materially
 and morally, and where women had equal status to men. It was the first 
European schooling structure that honed education down to seven 
essential subjects, later known as the seven liberal arts.<br>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
The word 'education' comes form the Latin <i>educere</i>
 meaning 'to lead out', pointing to the central doctrine that Socrates, 
under Plato's pen, elucidated so clearly - Knowledge is an inherent and 
intrinsic part of our soul structure. .... All these studies offer a safe and 
reliable ladder to reach the simultaneous values of the Truth, the Good,
 and the Beautiful. This in turn leads to the essential harmonious value
 of Wholeness.</span>" <br>
<br>
<b><span style="color:rgb(102,0,0)">So how does a creative mind work? Here's another take on it</span>:</b><br>
We
 are not status quo. We are not rebellious either. We are connected on 
many dimensions, to Nature, the Whole. So we are happy, peaceful, 
respectful and unconditionally loving. We are the scientists, engineers,
 artists, designers, athletes and others with highly developed skills, 
with a motive to keep things beautiful. The childlike essence of 
playfulness is key, as we come to the earth-sphere all-knowing, and 
quickly lose it, only to spend the rest of our lives <u>re-learning</u> it. Known and discussed since humans were able to pass ideas on.<br>

As an acorn grows into a grand oak, so too we all grow into 
something grand. How does it happen? What is it to be grand? The 
following rally cry of Latvian Art Directors Club (LADC), sums up much 
of what I feel: <br>

<div>Humanity
 is founded on those who create. On those who believe in their hearts, 
as opposed to the opinion of the majority. On those who prepared to quit
 the comfort zone and head off to destination where noone has ventured. 
Each of us harbours a revolution waiting to happen. Everyone was born to
 create archetypes. To build pyramids and discover new worlds. You walk 
through life with a heart of questions and a backpack full of 
opportunities. Help your biographer! Create, err, try, screw up, and 
fight. Don't waste the wonderful opportunity to live. Don't sit there 
and become a researcher of human life, an observer of the world, a 
commentator, one of those who only exist to say: "See, what did I tell 
you! I knew it was going to end in failure!" The world has enough 
unpublished poets, bar fly millionaires, kitchen geniuses and sauna 
generals. There are enough of those who come up with mighty ideas on 
Friday evening, but who lack the courage to realize them on Monday. We 
have enough of those who don't know what it means to work, to invest 
their entire soul into an idea, to defend it as they would defend their 
child, suffer, fight, and ultimately succeed.<font size="3"><br>

					Cilvēce balstās uz tiem, kas rada. Uz tiem, kas tic savai sirdij, 
nevis vairākuma viedoklim. Uz tiem, kas gatavi pamest komforta zonu un 
doties turp, kur neviens vēl nav bijis. Jo ikviens no mums sevī nes 
nerealizētu revolūciju. Ikviens ir dzimis, lai radītu šedevrus. 
Lai celtu piramīdas un atklātu pasaules. Tu ej pa dzīvi ar jautājumu 
pilnu sirdi un iespēju mugursomu. Palīdzi savam biogrāfam! Radi, 
kļūdies, mēģini, izgāzies, cīnies. Bet neiznieko brīnišķīgo iespēju būt 
dzīvam. Nesēdi un nekļūsti par citu cilvēku dzīves pētnieku, par 
pasaules novērotāju, par komentētāju, par vienu no tiem, kas dzīvo tikai
 tādēļ, lai sacītu: „Redz, vai es neteicu! Tikpat tur nekas nesanāca!” 
Pasaulē pietiek nepublicētu dzejnieku, bāra letes miljonāru, virtuves 
ģēniju un saunas karavadoņu. Pietiek tādu, kas klāsta varenas idejas 
piektdienu vakaros, bet kuriem pirmdien tikpat pietrūks drosmes tās 
īstenot. Mums pietiek to, kas nezina, ko nozīmē strādāt, ielikt visu 
savu dvēseli idejā, aizstāvēt to kā savu bērnu, pārdzīvot, cīnīties un 
galu galā - uzvarēt. <br>
