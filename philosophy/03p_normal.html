Jounral - "Being Normal"
<hr>

<div><b>Being Normal</b></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>
<div class="sites-codeblock sites-codesnippet-block"><code>"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."</code></div>
</div>
<div><i>&lt;Antoine de Saint-Exupery&gt;</i></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I am Latvian-Canadian, and am strongly influenced by both cultures. Luckily they are more similar than different.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>One big difference is goal setting. In Canada, I was taught that "success" means being&nbsp;<span style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt">"the best"; that I must be "motivated" everyday to "fight" the battle up the ladder of success.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In Latvia, however, our goal is to be "normal". If something works out we say "everything went normal". Normal is the&nbsp;<span style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt">truest self, whatever it may be, a baker, an accountant, a maestro singer.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt">Our truest self is also our integrity, our boundaries, our feelings and highest essence that is in harmony&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt">with the Universe.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt">It is also your ability to fit in "our normal" into the harmony, balance, in other words, normality, of the world.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>As a consequence, "being normal" has no relevance to man-made ideas of success, such as financial wealth,&nbsp;<span style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt">career or personal status, political or religious direction.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>As we pursue our normal, we understand that at every step of our growth and development through life, we have&nbsp;<span style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt">opportunity to be normal, and hence successful. Like an acorn growing into a large integrate oak tree,&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt">we realize that we are perfect every step of the way, if we so choose.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt">No matter what life and fate throws at us, good or bad, it is our reaction to it, our free will, that gives&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt">us an opportunity to be normal in that moment. We choose to be normal and successful in the morning,&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt">and pursue the day free willingly aiming for normality. I have found this a much easier mindset to life, especially&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt">in the most trying times.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The quote on the start, to me means that when we take away our own mental boundaries blocking our true self,&nbsp;<span style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt">then that is perfection, as we are then truest selves at the core. No matter what we do then,&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:transparent;font-size:10pt">it has an opportunity to be perfect in the normality of the world as well.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>I believe Nature is not selfish or controlling. My catch-line and motto "<i>listening to Nature,&nbsp;</i></div>
<div><i>being in harmony with Nature</i>" is another way of saying that I am trying my best to be "normal". &nbsp;</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>sending You lots of sparkling light!</div>
