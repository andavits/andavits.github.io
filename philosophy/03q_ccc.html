Jounral - "Choir Choir Choir Blog"
<hr>

My short singing adventure with Choir!Choir!Choir! in Toronto, from fall 2017 through spring 2018.
<br>
<br>
It all started during 2017 august eclipse and full moons signing in the age of Aquarius. All of a sudden, my voice kicked in, and I felt a strong spiritual energy of synchronicity. <br>

This motivated me to join a choir. The large Latvian Song Festival Choir is my long term goal. Now begins the baby steps to get there. Found Choir!Choir!Choir! online, and so it starts. This choir works because of synchronicity. We show up at a small club in Toronto, Clinton's, practice a song in 3 part harmony for 1 hour, and then record. The result is not perfect, but is far better than most would think for a group of people who for the most part do not know each other. How does this happen? It is synchronicity, I believe, and that feeling of being in synch with others was also a powerful motive of mine. It feels very intuitive now, as it the age of Aquarius.

Tom Petty and Heartbreakers - "<i>Free Fallin</i>"</b>
</font><br>
I was ready to sing "Bittersweet Symphony", but Tom Petty died the day before, so when I arrived at the club to sing, we did “Free Falling” instead, and I had no chance to go over it first. The harmony is divided into 3 groups, simply called, lows, mids and highs. I sang highs. During recording, I messed up singing one too many refrains in middle just before guitar solo, but it was edited out in youtube video, so it sounded ok in the end.

<br>
The following week was The Verve - "BitterSweet Symphony", but missed it. Here’s how it sounded. I would have liked it and sung well. Oh well. We will sing it again some time.

Sang lows this time, and got lost behind some tall guys and could not see anything. The lows did not feel as natural as highs or mids. Concluded the highs are the most natural for me right now with this choir.

Gord Downie Tribute</b></font>
<br>
Tragically Hips’ Gord Downie died. C!C!C! did tribute at Nathan Philips Square. Lyrics downloaded. Just sang bunch of songs, no harmony. There was supposed to be a youtube video, but the sound quality was bad with that stage, so don’t know if they will be able to get a decent one.

Sung the lows, as that is where I ended up standing in the megacrowd, under the elevators next to the stage. There were estimated 10,000 singers packed deep into the hallways of the mall. Not a big enough venue for the turnout, but that makes it more cozy and fun too. The song was simple to learn and fun, but people were more reserved when recording. Afterwards the free singalong was big spontaneous fun. Another great evening with Torontonians.

I could barely read. I tried to relax. I wanted to do it right because it was David Bowie, and put too much pressure on myself, so much my brain blanked out. I lost the intuitive synchronicity that just guides me through the songs. The folks around me seemed to sound ok, but video was not posted.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div>The choir was to sing for musical. I was drawn to this, even though I am not religious. I am an empath, so I feel much of the universal energies of love and light, including in the past year the Christ consciousness, which is beautiful, by the way. However, my experience with religious organizations has been bad, which to me have been a places of authoritarianism and hypocrisy. Jesus Christ Superstar is a rock opera and not religious scripture, and the song "Jesus Christ Superstar" questions the hypocrisy that seems to take over religions. I managed to grab one of the last tickets, so ended up in the balcony to sing. I sang the highs, and we sounded great :) I enjoyed singing this much more than I expected too.&nbsp;</div>

That too was unusual as I usually have my phone turned off for the night so I can sleep. The message was from CCC. Get you tickets at precisely midnight to sing with Rick Astley tomorrow! This was the most fun I have had in a long long time. Rick came in right on time, passed right by me, was super friendly, and I managed an autograph as he left!! I was smiling so hard though the whole that my cheeks were ready to burst. I am singing the highs in my usual place, to the far right.&nbsp;</div>
