<b>passion, not perfection</b></span></p>

Erin’s wipeout picture.

I don’t like to post wipeouts
of “<i>the kids</i>”, because of the
reaction of all that are not involved in any way, but self-righteously believe
that they know everything, and start their “you should this and that… and you
have to this and that… and you you you…” They present themselves as a saintly
omnipotent god, and feel that their presence is a blessing for all. When I
point out their delusion, they are stunned, and usually become even more
arrogant, but most importantly, they never ever actually do or try anything
themselves. Why is that? 


<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Lets face it, Erin is a world champion already, in the vocation of her
choosing. She is already successful. She does not need any of us to teach her
anything, as she has it all figured out already. And the part she has figured
out the best, is the part she is doing here. Dealing with blowouts, failures. </span></p>



<p>Erin<span style="font-size:10.0pt"> is a self-professed perfectionist, so put everything
into this race to make it perfect, and then blowing out, hurts, real bad. The
body hurts, the pride much worse. I’ll assume, as I am not with her today, that
her reaction to this failure, would be the same as it was when she was much younger:
She will be an emotional mess for 60 minutes to 24 hours. Like Dala Lama says,
emotions are like a wave, they come in and then they leave, quite naturally, so
we do not need to do anything, but let them do their thing. After this, Erin will rethink what happened. Then she will be sad
that things are not working out. Then she will ask herself why she is doing
this. Then she will remind herself that it is because she loves what she is
doing. Like a kid learning to ride a bike, the mere trying is the fun, the
high. Kids do not care about wiping out. They just want to try all these new
things. That’s the fun. That’s the passion. So the end <i><u>goals</u></i> are ideals of <i><u>perfection</u></i>;
but the <i><u>process</u></i> is <i><u>passion</u></i>. With the reminder of
this childhood wisdom, she will find a private place to regroup, and be good to
go the next day. &nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Interestingly, this is not a
secret to Erin or other champions, but is the same for all of us. We all knew
this growing up, and as adults need to remind ourselves. So presently, I remind
myself, “live in the moment with passion”. </span></p>
