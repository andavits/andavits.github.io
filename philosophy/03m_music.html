Summer, the time of the year when many like to be in the forests, playing guitars and various zither instruments. One ancient zither that I played is the Latvian kokle. It looks like a mini-harp, and is best played by yourself in the forest. The name, "kokle" literally translates as "wood-tree object".<br>

I learned to play the oldest traditional Latvian songs on kokle, holding chord position with one hand, and strumming with other. Later I was introduced to improvisational method, where in addition to above, we can pick individual strings, with either hand. <br>
<br>

The following videos are of naturally talented improvisational kokle player, Laima Jansone. The first 3 videos are experiments, and the 4th is a formal recording, using elements of the first 3 trials. <br>

<br>

Trial 1 feels the BEAT of the forest<br>

Trial 2 feels the SOUNDS of the forest<br>

Trial 3 feels the EMOTIONS of the forest - a more melodic feel.<br>

The final piece is called Zalktis. This is a snake symbol, a common totem in much of the world, symbolizing the link between the earth plane and the whole Universe. It's easiest to feel that link and the serenity it provides, in the forest.<br>
