What's it like being an oddball?<br> In other words, what's it like being me? 

<P onClick="para1.style.display=para1.style.display == 'none' ? '' : 'none'">Here's my story: <span style="color: green;font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt">click here</span></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE id=para1 style="display:none">
    I loved waterskiing even before I could waterski. I was the first in the family to be intersted in waterskiing, I was a female in a male dominated sport, and I had physical disabilities. Still, despite these obstacles, making my life about water skiing, was not a fight or even a concern. That's what it is like when you really are passionate about something. All familial and society norms, all financial and physical hardships, all the sabotages from the ones closest to me ... were no match. It simply did not matter, because I was operating from the heart-space. <br><br>

Part of operating from the heart space, is the passion to share what you know and love with others. When I was not water skiing, I was teaching others to waterski, for no other reason than my enjoyment of it. Later it became my formal “job" as well. As soon as I was legally old enough, I became a certified water ski instructor. I created my own water ski school and taught at many waterski schools in Ontario (Clareville Water Ski Centre in Toronto, New Frenda Camp in Muskoka, Canadian Adventure Camp in Temagami, McClintock's Water Ski School in Cambridge). I was also a water show skier with Toronto's CNE Aquarama Show, and became a sanctioned competitive skier working my way up the national level, with waterski sponsorships. <br><br>

I am so grateful for many people in the competitive water ski community who stepped up to help me, starting with Lloyd Alexander when I was just 10 years old at the cottage. We had a healthy reciprocal working relationship where he taught me all the technicalities of water ski driving and site preparation so that I could help him with his water skiing and other water ski projects. Then the Walker brothers pushed my water skiing to a competitive level. Wally Sokolowski managed the practical administrative aspects for my competitions, starting from novice through sanction. Tom "Tucker" Muir always made sure I was okay while training at the sanction level, where I became  Ontario Champion, Eastern Canadian Water Ski Champion in 1992, and have Nationals medals from 1991 and 1992 championships.

<blockquote>
Anda calls herself an "oddball", which for her means being a <b>trailblazer fueled by an unyielding passion</b>. Despite facing multiple layers of challenges—gender norms in a male-dominated sport, physical disabilities, family and societal expectations, financial hurdles, and even sabotage from those close to her—her love for waterskiing transcended every single one.<br><br>
Her story paints a picture of someone who operates from a deep, authentic place. When you're in that "heart-space," obstacles simply become irrelevant. This passion didn't just drive her personal achievements; it also compelled her to <b>share her knowledge and joy with others</b>, turning her love for waterskiing into a profession and inspiring those around her.<br><br>
She has built an impressive legacy, not only as a successful athlete and instructor but also as someone who defied expectations and achieved excellence on her own terms. Her narrative highlights the power of <b>perseverance, intrinsic motivation, and the importance of community support</b> in overcoming adversity.<br><br>
It seems that for Anda, being an "oddball" isn't about being an outsider; it's about having an extraordinary inner drive that sets her apart and allows her to achieve remarkable things.
