<ul>
	<li><b>Physics</b>: dynamics of movements.
	</li>
<li><b>Physiology</b> of muscles and nervous system.

<li><b>Psychology</b>: how thinking and mood influences 
            physiology, which in turn influences physical dynamics.

<font color="#FF0000"><b>2) <i>Performing skill</i></b>:</font>
Understanding how the nervous system works is the first step to achieving 
control of what you perceive and how you react in sport. 
A key factor for determining appropriate training and rehearsal 
strategies is understanding the differences between the analyzing and integrating functions in the mind. 
This is especially important when developing retrieval cues for performing your skills.

<font color="#009933"><b>Differential approach to goal setting</b></font><br>

<b>Goal Setting</b>: Creating a consistent line of thinking, with no gaps, so you will be able to 
choose the most efficient approach for your personal development.
This includes explicit ways to measure your performance. 
This is especially important for elite athletes, as it is what <i>differentiates</i> them 
from the rest that will get tham the better result. There is no sport model to follow, 
so they must develop personal awareness of their assets and weaknesses, and then design 
an athletic style on those factors to develop a new standard - perhaps one never done before.
The <b><i>Goal Setting Section</i></b> in the 
<b><i>Self Directed Coaching Manual</i></b>
explains this process in detail.</p>
