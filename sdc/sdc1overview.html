This is a neuropsychology resource for elite athletes.
Here you will find neuropsychological resources for elite atheletes to aid in motor 
learning and performing. This site uses differential psychology, which studies 
individual differences in behaviour.<br>

Common reaction to sport psychology stuff:

None-the-less, sport psychology <i>is</i> important because

Many international level athletes say 
<font color="#FF0000">"I'm pretty well on my own"</font>
when referring to the integration of resources into a 
progressive competitve package.
Unfortunately, this touches the backbone of what 
coaching is all about:

<div style="display:block;text-align:left"><img src="images/help.gif" border="0"></div>

<dl>
<dt><font face="ARIAL"><b>The Coaching Task</b></font>
</dt>
<dd>
To create an individualized training and competitive program for 
an athlete. The coach must use sound methodology to find and 
integrate appropriate resources. 
</dd>
<dt><font face="ARIAL"><b>Final Goal of Athlete</b></font> 
</dt>
<dd>To be self-reliant. So when elite athletes find themselves in 
a position of being "pretty well on their own", then at least 
they can be confident that they are seeing things clearly and
reasoning clearly. Essentially, they are their own coach.

<font face="ARIAL" color="#009966"><b>NEUROPSYCHOLOGY</b></font> is "a science that seeks to integrate 
psychological observations on behaviour and the mind with neurological observations on the 
brain and nervous system." <font face="ARIAL" color="#009966"><b>DIFFERENTIAL PSYCHOLOGY</b></font> 
studies individual differences in behaviour.
<p>

<font color="FF0000">Traditional <u>services</u> provided by a sport psychologist:</font><br>

imagery training, arousal management, attention, relaxation training,  
competitive pressure management, motivational strategies, 
substance abuse management, eating disorders, weight management, and 
programs to cope with retirement.

As you can see, there are many programs for councelling athletes 
and many <i>subjective</i> performance enhancement strategies. 
To be more <i>objective</i>, SDC uses neuropsychological concepts top develop
<b>a more explicit definition and application of how athletes are perceiving and reacting</b>.
These principles aid motor learning and performing 
by creating a link between the physics of movement and sport environment, with the perception
and thinking behind it.

<font color="FF0000">Traditional <u>research</u> in sport psychology:</font><br>
The goal is to find commonalities amongst elite athletes, and then developing 
programs to "mold" a world champion, based on these commonalities.

There are a lot of problems with this approach. See <a href="sdc3misunderstood.html">why elite athletes are misunderstood</a> <a href="reference.html#misunderstood"></a> for a more detailed explanation.
Rather than "molding" athletes, SDC uses a <b>differential approach</b>: 
<i>nurturing</i> an athletes assets, be it physical, 
cognitive, personality etc., and then integrating them into a unique 
package. This is because athletes at the international level are 
differentiated by their uniqueness, not their similarities to one another.

<font color="009966"><b>In summary, the goal of this SDC site is to develop more explicit control 
over what an athlete is perceiving and how s/he is reacting in a sport situation (i.e. neuropsychology),  
along with consistent purpose and direction in training. (i.e. differential psychology) 
Most importantly, these ideas should work in a self-directed fashion, 
so the athlete is self-sufficient and in control.
Specifically, SDC is a guide of questions athletes can ask themselves to find the solutions 
for better tournament performance.
The focus is on the process (methodology), and not the end result; 
because for many elite athletes, setting a new standard means breaking into new ground 
which noone has defined yet.<br>
