<dd>At first glance, sport psychology looks like the analysis of anxieties and fears in sport. If you have ever taken competitive sport seriously, as I have, sport psychology is learning new skills. It then becomes a mind over body thing when doing physiotherapy. But, in the end, sport psychology is about our drive to achieve something and all the questions that come with that. Why am I doing this? Why is it so important? What exactly am I trying to achieve, to prove and so on. </dd>

Sport psychology, and practicing competitive sports, is a great tool to help us evaluate ourselves in Life. For those who do not like active involvement, passive involvement, through the sports entertainment industry is huge. It has been a form of entertainment since the beginning of human kind. It's reality TV per say. We reflect on others' experiences to re-evaluate our own. So no matter from what perspective you take it in, it is relevant. </dd>

My fascination of high-order neurological functioning evolved coincidentally, 
by virtue of being with many elite athletes, and my strong understanding 
of computers.</p>
<p> 
Architecturally, parallel processors (humans) are a series of venoidam 
machines (regular computers). <i>Architecturally</i> is the operative word 
here. Although at the grass roots level, both silicon and carbon based 
systems function with same fundamental principles, regular computers 
perform tasks differently than humans. 
Silicon is good at performing algorithms precisely, 
while organic-ware is good at making quick decisions using generalizations.</p>
<p>
Considering the complexities and speed of reaction required in high-end sports, 
it is impossible to build an algorithm, yet alone an android, 
to perform these feats. Hence my initial argument explained in the 
overview and coaching links: you cannot <i>mold</i> 
a world champion, because this requires a prototype - a theoretical android - 
which does not exist. Elite talent <i>can be nurtured</i> by 
developing understanding and control over what the athlete is perceiving 
and how s/he is reacting in training and competition. 
The more integrated, or elite, a system is, the more individualized this 
process becomes. </p>
<p>

Unfortunately, because of my strong philosophical direction of proactive nurturing  
(not molding) elite talent, I do not have an academic mentor in sport 
psychology. I received my formal education in psychology at Wilfrid Laurier 
University, Ontario, Canada, and continue my studies as finances and time permit.</p>

<dd><font color="FF0000"><i>Self Directed Coaching Manual</i></font>
<ul><li>This educational document attempts to structure research into a form that is meaningful for elite athletes. It is in layman's language, hopefully without too much loss in explicit content. Specifically, this manual provides a decision-making model for creating athletes' competitive programs. Scientific data available in motor learning, performance and other aspects of sport psychology is presented, along with suggestions on where to find more information. Overviews of the relevance of each section, and many diagrams and tables are an attempt to make it more user-friendly. (2011 manuscript)

<dd><font color="FF0000"><i>Burnout in Elite Athletes</i></font>
<ul><li>Burnout is defined along a continuum of low to high, so burnout is at one end of the continuum while  actualization is at the other. Different models of burnout along with retroactive treatments are discussed. Proactive treatments, created by increasing protective factors and decreasing risk factors of burnout are discussed, along with an argument for more weighted use of proactive coaching methods for elite athletes.
