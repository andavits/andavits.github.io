<p>We can use scientific method to
improve the accuracy of measuring performance, and hence improve accuracy of
goal setting. I am a strong advocate of the scientific method and the community
behind it, but a full discussion of this is beyond the scope of this manual. I
will quickly review some of the lines of thought in this discipline and leave
it up to you to explore it further. <b>Scientific
methodology</b> is a logical procedure used to describe and infer natural
phenomenon. It gives us the ability to conclude whether our performance result
happened by chance alone, or because of our intervening variable, or because of
a confounding variable. For example, our improved performance (DV) could be as
a result of our equipment change (IV) that we deliberately made, or by a
confounding variable (we had cherrios for breakfast instead of wheaties), or by
some other unexplained phenomenon (by chance). When we carefully control
these variables we can make some statistically probable decisions as to which
situation did indeed occur. </p>

<p>The goal of the athlete is to
increase the probability of good performances and at the same time decrease the
probability of bad performances. Retrospectively, we can say that we are increasing
the probability of protective factors and decreasing the probability of risk
factors.</p>

<p>Here is a summary of <b>scientific methods</b> that can be used in
sport application. We can make all our decisions based on our personal <b>statistical norms</b>. We consider our
average performance and not our absolute best or worst performances.
Specifically, consider our average course conditions, our average personal
performance. We can make an operational definition of the dynamics and other
physiological and emotional aspects of our movements. I discussed this earlier
in this section. Then we can compare ourself to others or ourself to ourself. </p>

<p>The scientific method is an
amazing tool, so do let my generalizations trivialize the great techniques used
in scientific thought. In the scientific community we do not sell ideas, we
prove them. The oxymoron is that we can never completely prove an idea. The
best we can do is <i><font color="#ff0000">suggest</font></i> a
possibility. In the words of Socrates, “wisest is she who knows that she does
not know”. As long as we are comfortable living without absolute truths, we
will be able to think out our goals more accurately in terms of probabilities.
It will be easy for us to make choices based on realities, and not quick
rationalizations.</p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10pt;background:none repeat scroll 0% 0% rgb(254,223,152)">SCIENTIFIC METHODOLOGY</span></b></p>
<p><b>Scientific methodology</b> is a logical procedure used to describe and
infer natural phenomenon. It gives us the ability to conclude whether our
performance result happened by chance alone, or because of our intervening
variable, or because of a confounding variable. An <b>intervening variable</b> or <b>independent
variable (IV)</b> is what we are <i><font color="#ff0000">changing</font></i>.
A <b>dependent variable (DV</b>) is what we
are <i><font color="#ff0000">measuring</font></i>. The change in measure <i><font color="#ff0000">depends on</font></i> what was changed: IV. A <b>confounding variable</b> is something other
than our intervening variable making the change. A placebo in medicine is a
confounding variable. By <b>chance alone</b>,
it is meant that there is no knowledge as to why things happened as they did.
The results happen <font color="#ff0000">“by chance”</font>. When we carefully control these variables we
can make some statistically probable decisions as to which situation did
occur.</p>

<p>Scientific explanations are
built on previously existing data. Vaguely stated, previous data is either
re-proven, disproved or extended. One scientist research ideas are built on the
shoulders of thousands of others. Together, this becomes a <b>scientific community</b>, in which <i><font color="#ff0000">schools
of thought</font></i> develop and evolve.</p>

<p>Scientific evidence is
considered either conclusive, or not conclusive. <b>Conclusive evidence</b> is when the situation under study is
operationally defined with good controls. The intervening variable produced the
dependent variable as predicted. An <b>operational
definition</b> is an explanation of an experience in terms of what <font color="#ff0000">“operations”</font>
happen in the event. <b>Controls</b> are
the factors in the environment that reduce the probability of confounding
variables. We <font color="#ff0000">“control”</font> the environment and hence all assumptions of the
situation. <b>Inconclusive evidence</b>
means that we cannot conclude anything from the study. There is <i><font color="#ff0000">bad validity</font></i> and/or <i><font color="#ff0000">bad reliability</font></i>, and/or <i><font color="#ff0000">bad
controls</font></i>. <b>Validity</b> means that
what we think that we are measuring is indeed what is being measured. <b>Reliability</b> means that under the same
conditions the results would be the same. Causality is rare in the natural
scientific world. Human behavior is a result of many variables so in psychology
we talk of risk factors and protective factors. <b>Risk factors</b> increase the probability of problems, while <b>protective factors</b> decrease the
probability of problems.</p>

<p>Consider the following when
measuring our performance results. What we are measuring varies depending on
whether we are average or elite level athlete. For an average athlete our
performance, called <font color="#ff0000">dependent variable, DV</font>, is measured directly by our
improved performance. Improved performance is based on variables the
competition judges use to measure our standing. For an elite athlete, our
performance, called dependent variable, DV, is measured by reduced variability
in our performance. The learning curve at this point has flattened out, so a
reduced variability in our performance, increases the consistency in our
performance, which is overall improvement. Once high consistency has been
reached, we can take the next step towards improvement. </p>

<p>We use inductive reasoning to
define something that has not yet happened. For example, inductive reasoning is
used to define shape of a learning curve into the future. Inductive reasoning
is the decision process used to come up with new idea based on what has
happened in the past and other relevant knowledge. We will have to use this
line of thought extensively when designing our athletic program. We can prove
the learning curves’ <font color="#ff0000">reliability</font> (consistency) and <font color="#ff0000">validity</font> (does what I say it
would do) in retrospect only. </p>


<p>Now lets quickly recap the
scientific method and what it can do to measure sports performance.<font color="#ff0000"> Real time
research</font> is dictated by real time situation and response from stimuli. A
scientific explanation builds on previous and existing data. <font color="#ff0000">Conclusive
evidence</font> means that under specific conditions with good controls, IV predicts
DVs.<font color="#ff0000"> Inconclusive evidence</font> means bad validity, reliability, controls. <font color="#ff0000">Causality</font>
is rare, so we talk of risk and protective factors instead. Goal of scientific
methodology is ability to control whether result is by <font color="#ff0000">chance alone</font> or because
of<font color="#ff0000"> intervening variable</font>.</p>


<p>The reason we use science, and
specifically principles of psychology, is to <u>develop control</u> of a
matter. The strength in science of psychology is its continual interest in
defining explicit ways to measure behavior (what you do). All human perception
and reaction is individually selective. Behavior can be measured <u>directly,</u>
from how our body is moving while we perform sport. Behavior is influenced by
what we <u>think and feel</u>. These identities can be measured as well. We do
not know mind-body connection, but we do know correlations. Behavior is
influenced by environment surroundings. Athletes must feel comfortable in
training and team environment. Then improvement can be nurtured by controlling
how athlete perceives and reacts to sport task. Perception and reactions can
also be measured.</p>

SPORT
PSYCHOLOGY</span></b>

<p>Sport psychology was first
defined in 1978 by Singer as "the science of psychology applied to
sport". It provides two types of services: <font color="#ff0000">performance enhancement
strategies</font>, and <font color="#ff0000">counseling for athletes</font>.</p>

<p>Psychology
is one if the youngest of all scientific disciplines, with its official
recognition in 1879. The sub-discipline of <font color="#ff0000">sport psychology</font> has only been
researched extensively since 1965. In 1985, the <b>Division of Exercise and Sport
Psychology</b> was recognized by the American Psychological Association.</p>

<p>Today it is required that both
athlete and coach use sport psychology principles to remain competitive. Many
sound research findings are already available, but they are still not being
communicated to athletes and coaches in a comprehensible format. </p>

<p>All <font color="#ff0000">coaching methodologies</font> use
some sort of sport psychology principles. Traditionally, sport psychology studies
motivation, fears, anxieties and social issues. I believe that the main
strength in the science of psychology, and hence in sport psychology, is in its
continual interest in defining explicit ways to measure behavior, i.e. what you
do. With these methods, learning strategies (learning skills and retrieval
cues), performing strategies (priming and attentional strategies), and
measuring of performance can be very precisely developed.</p>


<p><font color="#ff0000"> </font><b>Differential psychology</b> is the
study of <font color="#ff0000">individual differences</font> in behavior, opposed to normative or average
behavior. Specifically, it identifies and measures individual abilities and
traits. Differential psychology has been used in the study of intelligence,
which led to the identification of the components of intelligence. This led to
tests to quantify an individuals' level of these components. (i.e. general
intelligence). Motor learning follows a similar pattern of studying individual
differences such as identification and measurement of motor abilities. This is
not an easy task, so there are very few studies following this pattern. It
follows, that it is even harder to quantify good neuropsychological
applications that aid motor learning and performing. For now, the best an elite
athletes can do is use a self-directed process to reach their personal
potential. The quantified evidence will come with time.</p>
