<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)"><b><u><span style="font-size:10pt">Recursive Cycles of Behavior</span></u></b></span></p>

<p>Welcome to the first chapter in
Self Directed Coaching Manual. This manual presents problem-solving methods for
consideration by elite athletes. Theses methods are the founding principles and
algorithms researched in the science of psychology. One founding principle of human
behavior is that it is influenced by many factors and is procedurally
recursive. </p>

<p>Specifically, human behavior
follows a sequence. We find ourselves in a situation, we interpret the
situation, and then we respond to the situation, causing the initial situation
to change. The new situation is the cue for the cycle to repeat itself. The
resulting loop repeats forever. In psychological academic literature, this
recursive cycle is called<font color="#ff0000"> “S-O-R”</font>. “S” means <b>stimulus</b>. “O” means an <b>organism</b>,
which in this case is the athlete, and “R” means <b>response</b>. The response takes place in the mind and body. Both the
mind and body are controlled by the mind. Diagram<font color="#0000ff"> “<i>SOR flowchart”, figure 1-1</i></font>, visualizes this principle.</p>

<div style="border:solid black 1.0pt;padding:.2in 0.2in 0.2in 0.2in">
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(204,204,204)">Figure 1-1. SOR flowchart</span></p>
<div style="display:block;text-align:left"><img src="images/fig_1-1.jpg" width="259" height="400" border="0"></div>
</div>

<p>Another way to describe this recursive loop is by using an <i><font color="#0000ff">ABCE
framework</font></i>, as shown in <i><font color="#0000ff">figure 1-2a,
1-2b</font></i>. Here again, changes in development take the form of a spiral. The
spiral may be neutral, or positive towards actualization, or negative towards
burnout. Actualization is when a person has reached their full potential, while
burnout is when a person has lost interest in the activity they are working on.
</p>

<p>Notice that the loop has a
strong flow in one direction. When a change is made in the loop, it will affect
all the rest of the elements in the loop as well. Changes can be made to any
node (A, B, C or E) in the loop. Athletes can improve by changing what goes on
in their mind. This is called <b>cognition</b>.
Visualization and thinking positive thoughts are examples of mind processes.
Athletes can change what they feel. This is called <b>affect</b>. Controlling anxiety is an example of emotional intervention
which controls '<i><font color="#ff0000">affect</font></i>'. Athletes can also improve performance by changing what
their body does. This is called <b>behavior</b>
in the ABCE framework. For example. athletes may do a skill in a more efficient
way. Changes can also be made in athlete’s <b>environment</b>.
It may be that equipment changes are required for better performance. </p>

<p>As athletes, we can use the ABCE
framework to help us with the initial decisions on whether what is holding us
back: is it psychological, partially psychological, or nothing to do with
psychology at all. Equipment, obviously, has nothing to do with psychology. We
want to get the most improvement with the least amount of work. Once in a while
it is good to step back from micro-management of training, and check that our
focus is in the right direction in the big picture, the ABCE framework.</p>

<div style="border:solid black 1.0pt;padding:.2in 0.2in 0.2in 0.2in">
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(204,204,204)">Figure 1-2a. ABCE Framework</span></p>

<div style="display:block;text-align:left"><img src="images/fig_1-2b.jpg" width="184" height="200" border="0"></div>
</div>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)"><b><u>Towards Actualization</u></b></span></p>

<p>Recall, when the ABCE recursive
cycle is positive, we are moving towards actualization. <b>Actualization</b> is when something has reached its highest ability, or
highest good. <b>Self-actualization</b> is
reaching our own highest good. We are autonomous and efficacious. For this
manual, it is assumed that we were all brought here from a higher One Power or
Universe. We will assume that this Power or Nature has perfect harmony and is
good, so just by our mere birth into it, so are we. We are born good seeds, in
a Universe that has everything we need to grow well. Through our dependency
years, we may not have had access to all the Universe has to offer; however, in
our adult years, we can start searching and accepting all the support the
Universe has to offer. </p>

<p>Does that mean that if we
dream about being a world champion, that we could be one? No. Does that mean
that if we work my butt off, we can become a champion? No. Just dreaming an
idea, and working our butts off does not guarantee anything. The key is <b>appropriateness</b>. Does that mean that we
should believe others, when they say we are losers, and not capable? No. Again,
the key is appropriateness. By appropriateness, I mean that we are listening to
what our natural abilities are, and are not. That we are also listening to the
natural meridians of Life. To achieve anything outstanding, we have to network,
with other people, and our environment. Consequently, <b>listening</b> is also key. We will spend our whole lives listening and
learning how things naturally work around us, because the more realistic,
appropriate, our understanding, the easier things are for us. As an analogy,
when we go with the natural flow of a river, it is easy to negotiate; against
it, is almost impossible. We will spend our whole lives learning how things
naturally flow, but at the same time, we can feel safe, knowing that all is in
natural balance, and we are part of it. The process is to find the flow, and
step into it. This is the positive spiral in the ABCE framework.</p>

<p>What is this
“<font color="#ff0000">self-actualization</font>” we reach at the end of the positive spiral? It is
something different for everyone. I mentioned that “appropriateness” means
listening to what our natural abilities are, and are not. It appears, as
humans, we all seem to have this one thing we do really well, a bunch of other
things we do with average abilities, and some things that we cannot do at all.
However, for this manual, it is assumed that we are all still perfect in a
larger sense. The reasoning is Nature, and how she works, as a network. Every
plant and animal is dependent on something else to survive. As long as all just
take what they need, it all stays in balance, is healthy and perfect. So too
with humans. To contrast, if we were completely perfect within ourselves in
every way, we would have no need to network. Living to our highest good, means
to find our node within the network. It may be that our best talent is baking,
or accounting, or homemaker or a world champion of some sort. As humans, we
don’t have a simple instinctive plan that we just follow, as plants and animals
do. We have more capacities, so to find our highest good is more
difficult.</p>

<p>In summary, our goal as
humans is to self-actualize. This means that we strive for our highest good. We
listen and follow our abilities. We listen and follow Nature’s abilities. With
trial and error, we can all find our perfect place in this perfect Universe.
For some, it may mean reaching the highest world standard in something. </p>

<p>The rest of the manual is about
micro-managing for elite athletes. But please make sure to step back and
reflect on the big picture from time to time, to make sure you are on the right
tracks in the first place. Make sure all your effort is not for nothing. If
things are going smoothly, with minimum effort, it means that you’ve found the
right tracks. This is my wish for everyone.</p>

<b>solid foundation</b> <font size="1">(safe

</div>


<p>Building a good structure starts
with a <i><font color="#ff0000">solid foundation</font></i>. From there,
each step upward has to be solid, in order to support the higher steps. In a
sport, the solid foundation is a safe and nurturing environment. A great seed
still needs good soil and watering to grow into full blossom. Similarly, a safe
nurturing athletic environment, creates opportunity to explore new ideas
without fear of repercussions. See chapter 12 for full discussion.</p>

<p>Formation of <i><font color="#ff0000">solid steps</font></i> is achieved by proper goal
setting. Personal development happens in a step-like fashion. <i><font color="#ff0000">Self-actualization</font></i> occurs when we are
using all our capacities and growing to our full potential. We learn the skills
of a sport at the recreational level. At the elite level, we become autonomous.
This is done by “going back” and re-analyzing ourselves. Physically we would
re-analyze what we can do best with our body frame and gait, Psychologically,
we would “go back” analyzing our strongest psychological attributes. Being <i><font color="#ff0000">autonomous</font></i>, is when we have redefined
our method of doing our sport based on our strongest attributes. This makes us
most efficient, and also unique.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)"><b><u>Solid Foundation: What is healthy
environment?</u></b></span></p>

<p>An actualization environment
must be safe and nurturing. It must be a place where we can be autonomous, free
to learn and try out new ideas without repercussions. Some athletes feel a
larger purpose as well. This larger purpose goes beyond the athlete themselves.
For example, the athlete may want to do well to make the team do well, making
everyone happy. Or perhaps, the athlete sees themselves making the world more
beautiful by doing a beautiful performance. So this larger purpose is
altruistic. Chapter 12 offers a full discussion on healthy versus unhealthy
sporting environments. </p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)">&gt;<b><u>Solid Steps: How to define solid steps
athletes can stick too</u></b></span></p>

<p>Athletic development happens in
a step-like fashion. Given this understanding, we can define goals for
ourselves, taking this natural phenomenon into account. For now, though, I will
start with some foundational principles of goal setting and monitoring our
performance. In the following <i><font color="#0000ff">“Steps to
Actualization” flowchart, figure 1-3</font></i>, we see that building solid steps has
three considerations. We start by understanding what “elite standards” are.
Then we apply “controlled interventions”. Finally, we “monitor performance
systematically”.</p>

<div style="border:solid black 1.0pt;padding:.2in 0.2in 0.2in 0.2in">
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(204,204,204)">Figure 1-3. Steps to Actualization, flowchart</span></p>
<div style="display:block;text-align:left"><img src="images/fig_1-3.jpg" width="260" height="320" border="0"></div>
</div>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(159,197,232)"><u>Elite
Standards</u></span></p>


<p>The goal setting standards elite
athletes have are more accurately defined than at the recreational level. This
helps ensure safety, as there is increased risk of injury at higher level of
sport because of the powers exerted. Also, elite athletes are judged more
strictly as the competitions get tougher. The effort put in by elite athletes
is enormous, yet the variance of performance among the best is very little.
The stricter judging ensures fairness, as well as good feedback for athletes on
where to improve. I start my discussion with some broad definitions of
motivation and drive. Then I define what goal setting means at this level, with
special emphasis placed on the importance of commitment to the task. Lastly, I
re-examine the concept of “reality checking”, which I already touched on a bit
in discussions on self-actualization. </p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;background-color:rgb(234,209,220)"><i>Motivation and Drive</i></span></p>

<p>The word “<font color="#ff0000">motivation</font>” has Latin
root “<font color="#ff0000">motive</font>”, which means “<font color="#ff0000">to move</font>”. The psychological definition for
“motivation” means the probability of change taking place. The sport definition
or moniker “motivation” refers to the “drive” of the athlete to succeed. All of
the above definitions are too abstract for practical use, so I parse the word
meaning of motivation using a term from behaviorist approach of psychology,
where motivation is defined as probability of change taking place. Changes can
range from very specific biological responses in the nervous system, to very
complex emotional processes in the mind. For something to happen behaviorally,
the person has to be motivated. Being motivated requires two components. First,
the person must have <b>information</b> of
what needs to be done. Second, the person must <b>care</b> enough to do it. The following chart, <i><font color="#0000ff">“Motivation”, figure 1-4</font></i>, sums up these ideas.</p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;background-color:rgb(234,209,220)"><i>Goal Setting and Willpower</i></span>: </p>

<p>What is willpower? Willpower as
a word in everyday language that implies a phenomenon and psychological makeup
which allows some people to do hard jobs, overcome temptations and stick to
their goals. “She could do it because she has willpower.” “He cannot do it
because he does not have willpower.” But what is willpower? Is it an energy or
electric current? We are never told what it is. We are just labelled as either
having it or not. Perhaps it is better to think of willpower not as an entity
bestowed on us, but as a process that we can control. Control is achieved by
changing a situation to ensure it works. So willpower is really proper goal
setting. Successful athletes set goals that are achievable, so they are <i><font color="#ff0000">willing</font></i> to do them. </p>

<p>How do we set achievable goals?
The short answer is that we commit to finishing task. Defining goals based on <u><font color="#ff0000">tasks</font></u>
is the easiest to monitor. In sport, a task is a sequence of movements. This
sequence of movements can be divided into smaller units. The first task is
performed and finished (subgoal 1), the next task is performed and finished
(subgoal 2), and so on, until the whole sequence is complete (final goal).
Commitment to task completion is absolutely required for this method to work.
Notice that in the above sequence, I said that a task is performed and
finished. There is a tendency for us to ease up when the finish is in sight.
The problem is two-fold. First, we cannot make conclusions about our
performance during the task segment, because we varied our approach during the
segment. Second, we may lose the competition. A possible solution to ensuring
commitment to task completion, is to increase the margin of error. For example,
we can overshoot the goal or finish line. This way, we are performing at the
same intensity from start to finish in the task segment.</p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;background-color:rgb(234,209,220)"><i>Re-Examining Reality Check</i></span>: </p>
<p>Refer to the diagram at the end
of this chapter called<i> <font color="#0000ff">“Decision Making
Model”, figure 1-9</font></i>. Notice that when we set a goal, we want to <font color="#ff0000">“reality
check”</font> that it is correct. We do not want to <font color="#ff0000">“rationalize”</font>, which means that we
are only convincing ourselves that it is correct. If the goal is <font color="#ff0000">“realistic”</font> we
can easily commit to it and achieve it. Recall my discussion earlier on
self-actualization. I explained the importance to reflect on <font color="#ff0000">“big picture”</font> to
ensure that we are following our own natural abilities,as well as the laws of
Nature. The following are a few more angles explaining this idea. Clearly,
understanding this is important, hence the extra paragraphs. Again, all the
effort in the world will mean nothing, if it is inappropriately focused. </p>

<p>Learning how things work and
flow in a larger sense, is like learning how to use a computer. When we take
time to calmly sit down and learn it’s system, it works great. If we do not
follow the computer’s internal programs, laws, then is does nothing, or gives
us something we do not want. No matter how frustrated we get, or how
manipulative we get, the computer will not budge. It just waits, until we learn
its laws, and then it works great again. Nature’s laws are the same. The nature
of human beings, of the whole. Natural laws are consistent and same over time.
Technology changes, cultures change, but nature reacts in the same predictable
way it always has. So when things are difficult, perhaps it is because we are
not following nature’s laws. In contrast, when we do follow them, things seem
to happen easily and we have so much time. </p>

<p>An important element of Nature,
is that things get better and grow with nurturing, not control. If we complain,
are mad at ourselves or others, criticize or use manipulative control we are
handling the situation, but it does not change anything in the end. Instead, we
can think of positive nurturing ways to promote change we want.</p>

<p><span style="font-family:arial,sans-serif;background-color:rgb(234,209,220)"><i>Areas of Control in Sport</i></span>:</p>

<p>Controlled intervention is a
process: The athlete decides what to build (analyzing) and then makes it happen
(integrating). When <b>analyzing</b>, we
ask “What needs to be done?” When <b>integrating</b>,
we ask, “How do I do it? For example, “How does anxiety dissolve?, “How do I
make sure I can do a triple toe loop in competition?” This text is primarily
focused on integration.<font color="#0000ff"> <i>Figure 1-5</i>

<p>Now that we have our goal setting
algorithm in place, we can start micro-managing. To decide the target control,
it is&nbsp; good to have an operational
definition of our sport requirements. What are the dynamics and corresponding
physiology of the sport? What kind of concentration or emotion is required in
the sport? The<i> chart <font color="#0000ff">“Defining Sport
Requirements”, figure 1-6</font></i><font color="#0000ff">,</font> shows a partial list of variables that can be
used to define athletic tasks. Continuum is defined using dichotomies
representing each pole of a continuum. This makes it easy to measure progress.
Start by using this chart to provide a broad definition of sport requirements.
Then decide where intervention can be made to improve performance. This is the
analytic stage. Now athletes can use this manual to find techniques to make
this happen. This is the integration stage.</p>

a downhill racer has to be alert to absorb the constantly varying information
the course is presenting, whereas a&nbsp; long
distance runner will be in a trance state because running is an automatic
repetitive task. One is highly suggestible when in a trance state with eyes
half closed. “Just go” may be the only thought in a runner’s mind. With respect
to concentration requirements for downhill racer versus long-distance runner,
entirely different training approaches are required. A runner’s approach would
be more weighted towards motivational strategies, whereas a downhill racer’s
strategies would be more weighted on concentration of the task itself.</font></dd>

The mind-body connection is
still a mystery, however we can develop correlations between the mind and the
body. Specifically, when the body does this, then the mind does that, and vice

<p><b>Physics</b><span style="font-size:10pt"> means the dynamics of the movements. <b>Physiology</b> refers to the functions of your muscles and tendons. <b>Psychology</b>
refers to how faculties of the mind influence your body physiology. To develop
a concrete link between what we do and the psychology behind it, ask the
following questions in sequence. What are the most efficient dynamics for the
movements? What is the physiology of movements? Specific muscle contractions
etc needed to create these movements. What does the nervous system do to make
this happen? Is there anything we can think about or experience that can
influence the nervous system to do the athletic task we want? </span></p>

<p>For those who like categorizations, I’ve created two categorical dichotomies. Prospective versus
retrospective interventions. Task-orientated versus motivational-oriented
interventions. These are summarized in chart <i><font color="#0000ff">“Controlled Intervention Comparisons”, figure 1-7</font></i>.</p>

<div style="display:block;text-align:left"><img src="images/fig_1-7.jpg" width="400" height="269" border="0"></div>
</div>

<p><b>Retrospective viewpoint</b>: “<font color="#ff0000">Retro</font>” means “<font color="#ff0000">back</font>”. “<font color="#ff0000">Spect</font>” means
“<font color="#ff0000">view</font>”. When we reflect on what we have done, we are retrospecting. In this
manual, the retrospective viewpoint refers to fixing things that have not gone
right. It is assumed that <u><font color="#ff0000">we know what we want</font></u>, but are not achieving
it. For example, an athlete performs a cartwheel incorrectly. The athlete has
done this physical behavior correctly in the past. A retrospective intervention
will get the cartwheel done properly again. For example, mentally, an athlete
may experience great anxiety during competition, yet in practice does not. A
retrospective intervention will try to simulate the anxiety-free state of
practice, to that of the competition.
<br>
 
<b>Prospective viewpoint</b>: “<font color="#ff0000">Pro</font>” means “<font color="#ff0000">forward</font>”. "<font color="#ff0000">Spect</font>” means “<font color="#ff0000">view</font>”. When we look to
learn something new, we are prospecting. In this manual, the prospective
viewpoint refers to learning new things. It is assumed that <u><font color="#ff0000">we do not know
our future abilities</font></u>, and therefore have to make an educated guess on what
they could be, and then learn them. For example, physically, an athlete may
want to learn how to do a somersault off a diving board. The athlete would use
a prospective viewpoint to devise a learning sequence to achieve this. For
example, mentally, and athlete may want to increase control of their
competition sports performance. The athlete would use a prospective viewpoint
to learn retrieval cues that can be used for priming before sports performance,
and attention cues during sports performance.</p>

<p>In the coaching manual
introduction, I introduced the common division in coaching approaches. That
being task-orientated and motivational-orientated coaching.<b> Motivational orientated coaching</b>,
involves describing the sport skill to be done, and then encourages the athlete
to perform it. <b>Task orientated coaching</b>,
involves describing the sport skill to be done by dividing the behavior into
task units. The athlete is told to do the first task, and then finish it, and
then do the next task, finish it, and so on, until the whole unit of behavior
is complete. This manual focuses on pragmatic ways to divide a sport skill onto
task units. The methodical approach gives us more control over our behavior,
and as a result, more confidence. This confidence, in turn, makes us less
timid, which encourage us further. So a task-orientated approach influences our
“drive” to succeed. In other words, motivation.
In conclusion, a task-orientated point of view gives most control,
because it more naturally follows elite level standards</p>
