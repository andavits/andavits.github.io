<b><u>Introduction to Self-Directed Coaching Manual</u></b>

<p>SDCM, Self Directed Coaching Manual,
is a teaching manual for athletes, with special focus on adult elite athletes.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>The foundational principles of the manual are as follows:</dt>
<dd>The <u>goal of the athlete</u>
is to learn and rehearse skills so they can be retrieved tournament day.</dd>
<dd>The <u>goal of the coach</u> is to help the athlete achieve the above goal.</dd>
</dl>
<p>At some point, elite athletes
will find themselves on their own in terms of integrating their athletic
training package. There are usually many specialists helping the athlete, but
it is often up to the individualathlete
to decide the relevance and importance of this information. The <u>Goal Setting
Section</u> introduces problem solving methods to help the athlete decide their
personal direction. Then more specifically, the athlete can target an area of
development in the controlled interventions sections of the manual: <u>Control
of Physical Behavior</u>, <u>Control of Emotions and Environment</u></p>

<p>This manual is based on the
science of psychology, which studies the brain and nervous system. The main
question in psychology is “How does an individual react in a specific
situation?” Human behavior (what we do) takes into account the thoughts,
emotions, psychology and situation of the individual. This manual attempts to
apply psychological models of human behavior to help athletes in their sports
and training performance. I have designed this manual so no previous education
in psychology, physiology or kinesiology are required to understand the
content. Relevant principles in science of psychology are presented in <u>How
the Brain and Nervous System Work</u> section. </p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Most interest and research in
psychology, as in medical sciences, is on fixing problems, while
little emphasis is on prevention and reinforcement of positive capacities. This
manual’s primary focus is on the latter. Research in sport psychology attempts
to find similarities amongst groups of people. This is called demographics. For
example, elite athletes are demographically different from regular athletes. In
finding sport interventions for regular athletes, one can study the
demographic similarities of the group and design a program. In finding sport
interventions for elite athletes, demographic similarities have little value.
It is the uniqueness of the athlete, that makes them stand out. This manual
focuses on problem solving strategies that help elite athletes find what is
special about them in their sport. I consider elite athletes, not as a group
different from regular athletes, but as individuals. Throughout the manual,
there will be paragraphs discussing special considerations of elite athletes.</p>

<p><u><b>Creation of Self-Directed Coaching Manual</b></u></p>

<p>Most summers, I spend time
behind the scenes with the Canadian water ski team. I have trained alongside
them, sometimes recreational, sometimes more seriously. The Canadian water
ski team has had a unique reputation of breaking world records and winning
world championships for decades, starting in the 1970s.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1995, I’d recently finished a degree in psychology, and spent
that summer alongside Judy McClintock Messer, as she trained for and won the
world overall title in water skiing. My first reaction was “great”, but a
couple of months later it hit me. Why is it that members of this club are
always winning? Why are we winning and not others? The thing is, there is
nothing spectacular about us. We look average. We function like a typical
extended dysfunctional family; however, when we start water skiing, everything
falls into place and good things happen. The other thing that hit me, was the
disproportionate amount of club and team members who actually win a world
title. I reflected on this: what it is to win the worlds. I started to think of
a number of people in the world - billions, and then the proportion that try
waterskiing - a lot, and then the number that train, and then the ones who
manage better than anyone else. What was always a casual summer activity for
me, all of a sudden felt surreal, and this got my head spinning. </p>

<p>Later in 1996, I had some time
to put my thoughts down on paper. Initially, I jotted down what I found
intriguing about all of this. Then I decided to focus in what was done <u>right</u>
on the water ski team. I jotted memories of what had happened, constantly
reminding myself to avoid observational bias, as I was taught in university.
Then, I took these observations and integrated them into psychological
platforms that were used at the time. These platforms were still fresh in my
mind from university studies. The result was a visually-orientated, point-form
document called <u>Self-Directed Coaching Notes: How Elite Athletes Can Coach
Themselves</u>, or SDCN. Later, I added more visual aids for the notes, and
started a manuscript for the notes, but the written pedagogical version was not
coming along well, so I stopped. In 2007, the first manuscript trial was
written, called <u>Self Directed Coaching Manual</u>, and in 2011 the final
manuscript was completed. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, back on the water ski
dock, the newest generation, who I had been with since birth, had won the
worlds. In 2009, Whitney McClintock won the Slalom, Trick and Overall titles at
the World Water Ski Championships, breaking tournament records in the process.
Along with her brother, Jason McClintock, they helped team Canada win an
overall title as well at the same championships. Many others who train with
them, are also winning other international titles. So the good tradition
continues.</p>

<p>The practical process of learning and performing are in Section 3, especially, end points as stimulus control. The reader may want to start there, and refer to the other sections for supportive information as needed. I wrote this in logical sequence, but it is to be used as a reference manual, accessed anywhere, and parts would probably need to be re-read and reviewed a few times to understand to the point that the reader can apply themselves. Take your time. Be patient. It's all very simple once figured out.</p>
