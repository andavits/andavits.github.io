<p>The following are
intervention techniques that are most often used in sports. This is only a
listing of definitions and techniques. Details of application methodology are
beyond scope of this manual. Athletes’ can use this as general understanding of
techniques and services available to them. It is recommended that the athlete
consult a qualified professional for application for self, or do own follow-up
research at a reputable university.</p>

<p>The key to intervention is to develop control. In sport, the following often happens:</p>

<p>Professional western approaches that control physiological arousal, include <i><font color="#ff0000">progressive relaxation</font>, <font color="#ff0000">meditation</font>,
<font color="#ff0000">biofeedback</font>, <font color="#ff0000">autogenic training</font>, <font color="#ff0000">autohypnosis</font></i>. Consult a qualified
professional for application for yourself, or do your own research at a
reputable university. In general, some common quick applications of arousal
interventions commonly used by athletes. To <b>relax muscles</b>, we tighten muscle group we want relaxed, and then
loosen. In theory, the more powerful we tighten a muscle group, the more it
will relax when we are done. To <b>get
aroused and increase adrenaline</b>, we can increase our heart rate by jumping
up and down. To <b>get oxygen to your muscles</b>,
hyperventilate. To <b>slow heart down</b>,
we hold our breath.</p>

<p>Aaaaa!! A little bit of stress, from time to time is very good. It encourages us to move and
try. However, some stressors stay unresolved or accumulate over time. These
stressors can be big or small, but at the same point we have had enough. The
next stressor, even a small one, will destroy us. It is often called <font color="#ff0000">“last
straw effect”</font>.</p>

<p>We can control
stress with coping strategies. For athletes, the biggest concerns are negative
training stress and injury, which are often caused by stress.&nbsp; Sometimes called <font color="#ff0000">“training stress syndrome”,
TSS</font>, is the negative adaptation to training stress. A <font color="#ff0000">positive adaptation</font> to
training stress, leads to training gain. A <font color="#ff0000">negative adaptation</font> to training
stress, starts with lag in training gain, then staleness or slump, then
overtraining or work ethic problems, then burnout, and finally withdrawal from
sport activity altogether.</p>

<p>The chart<font color="#0000ff"><i>“Positive and Negative Adaptations to Stress”, figure 11-1</i></font>, I’ve charted stressors with the ABCE
framework, and motivational principles, which I discussed in the goal setting
section. It compares the <font color="#ff0000">environment</font> conditions, the <font color="#ff0000">cognitive (mind)</font> and
<font color="#ff0000">affective (emotional)</font> aspects of ourselves to the resulting behaviour. In this
case I’ve charted a <font color="#ff0000">positive stress response</font>, leading to training gain, versus
a <font color="#ff0000">negative stress response</font>, which eventually can lead to burnout and
withdrawal. This is another “big picture” that is good to review from time to
time to make sure we are on the right track overall.</p>

<p>The other thing
that seems to go hand in hand with athletes, is <u><font color="#ff0000">stress and injury</font></u>. The best way
to avoid injury is to take a quick inventory of our bodies, every day, and
right before a sport activity. Our body physiology, power, metabolism,
naturally oscillate up and down in a sinuous fashion. All things equal, our
bodies will sometimes feel super powerful, as if we can jump over buildings,
and sometimes, our bodies feel sluggish, as if they weigh 300 pounds. So when
we are cognizant of our natural biorhythms, and adjust the amount of power at
the top end that we exert, we decrease risk of injury. Our mind abilities also
fluctuate, and our body limbs also vary in power and flexibility. While
training we train considering our power abilities for the day. For competition,
if we are well rehearsed, we can usually go just a bit over our safety limit. A
good method to check our bodies, is to think of each part and check how it
feels. Start at the bottom with feet, and work up to head. </p>

<p>Course conditions,
and tournament <u><font color="#ff0000">environments</font></u> also can change. Again, we take inventory of the
situation, and only do what we are comfortable doing. The “do or die” attitude
still happens amongst some&nbsp; professional
athletic organizations, but in the end, the overuse, or overpowering of
activity, will lead to injury. We may get ostracized for being appropriately
cautious, but in the end we are injury free, and the other guy is not. We can’t
be the best with injury.</p>

<p>Anxiety can be
rational or irrational. Fear can be rational or irrational. The diagram <i><font color="#0000ff">“Anxiety and Fear flowchart”, figure 11-2</font></i>,
may help determine and categorize our experience and intervention requirements,
if any. We can decide what to do by asking the following questions in order. Is
there something wrong? Is it realistic or not? What should the appropriate
intervention be? Specifically, are we experiencing anxiety or fear? Is it
realistic and rational or unrealistic and irrational? We need a little fear and
anxiety to appreciation of dangers and motivate us to rehearse realistically
before attempt made. <b>Realistic fears</b>
can happen when we get a personal injury, crash or make a mistake. We may
conclude “I love skiing, skiing can kill”, which is realistic. Realistic fear
alerts us that something needs to change to make things safer. We can decrease
the probability of making a mistake, and hence realistic fear, with the
<font color="#ff0000">”control commitment”</font> in goal setting. <b>Realistic
anxiety</b> happens when we realize that we have no backup support. No
resources to note problems and solve them. We may conclude “I’m pretty well on
own.” The best way to deal with this is to improve self-sufficiency. Develop
autonomy and problem solving skills. In
contrast, irrational reactions are debilitating. <b>Irrational anxiety</b> happens when there is overreaction to
competition itself. We can deal with irrational anxiety retroactively using
psychological methods like RET. We can use proactive methods like distracting
our emotions by concentrating on task itself. This decreases emotional
metabolism and increases cognitive metabolism. <b>Irrational fear</b> happens when experience debilitating fear.
Psychological retroactive methods like extinction techniques are useful in
getting rid of this type of fear.</p>

<p>The following are some medical names of interventions for certain conditions. This
is to give the athlete an idea of how things are categorized professionally. We
can decrease the negative effects of anxiety <u><font color="#ff0000">directly</font></u>, by getting <b>rid of anxiety</b>. As explained earlier,
anxiety can be a result of oversensitization, undersensitization or
inappropriateness in response to situations. If we experience <b>oversensitization</b> to some stimuli in
environment,and if it is a debilitating unrealistic fear, such as post traumatic
stress syndrome or learned fear, then extinction techniques work best. If it is
an unrealistic anxiety, such as negative cognitive set, then use cognitive
behavioural interventions such as Becks, RET. If we experience <b>undersensitization</b> refering to being
desensitized, having no fear or being defensive, then our solution is to
develop realistic perception of the situation, by making an effort to
understand, and then develop control of the situation. If we experience <b>inappropriateness, </b>refering to
inappropriate cognitive sets and anxiety response patterns, which are
meaningful to anxiety, but meaningless to the real world, then our solution is
cognitive behaviour intervention, RET.</p>

<p>We can decrease
negative effects of anxiety<font color="#ff0000"> <u>indirectly</u></font>, by <b><i>ignoring anxiety.</i></b> This
method decreases negative effects of anxiety by focussing on the task instead
of focusing on the anxiety itself. By focusing on the anxiety, we&nbsp; may be re-enforcing the anxiety. By not
focusing on anxiety, it may start to fade. As a practical example, consider the
following. In practice everything we learned and is working properly, but in
competition, the emotions are different, there is anxiety, which results in bad
performance. Anxiety affects the area of the brain that is firing before and
during the competition, so unusual messages are sent to spinal cord, resulting
in bad performance. Our solution is to use a task-orientated approach, which
decreases anxiety by proper priming of controlled default mode, and then
stimulus control is used during the competition. Also, we can use attention
strategies for appropriate responses, as described in this manual. It is
important to acknowledge and accept the fact that a tournament is different
than training. When we become anxious during tournament, we can cue ourselves
to distract this cognition by reviewing previously created retrieval cues.</p>
