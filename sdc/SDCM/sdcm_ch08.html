<p>Our performance is triggered by retrieval cues. Our retrieval cues are triggered by
our attention. Attention is defined as <font color="#ff0000"><i>what</i>
</font>we focus on, and <i><font color="#ff0000">how</font></i> we focus. To
prepare for a good performance, we prime our brain and nervous system using
rehearsal techniques defined earlier. To actually execute what we rehearsed in
our mind, we need to trigger our retrieval cues by using proper attention
techniques.</p>

<p>Often in sport, we attempt to do a skill that is solid, but this time we cannot. Biologically,
this means that the skill is learned in the nervous system, but is not being
recalled properly. Something was working, but it is now broken, so we need to
fix it. I call these <b>retrospective
interventions</b>. (<font color="#ff0000">“retro”</font> means <font color="#ff0000">back</font>. <font color="#ff0000">“spective”</font> means <font color="#ff0000">look</font>. <font color="#ff0000">“intervention”</font>
means <font color="#ff0000">change</font>.) We find answers by looking back to find what to change to fix
the problem. </p>

</span></b></u></p>
<p><u><b><span style="background-color:rgb(249,203,156)">FIXING PROBLEMS WITH PERFORMANCE</span></b></u></p>

<p>Recall,that it is what we pay attention too and how we focus, that trigger our
performance retrieval cues. Therefore, being perfectly primed does not
guarantee good performance. However, being perfectly primed <u><font color="#ff0000">along with</font></u>
proper attention cues does, almost certainly does. Recall, that the basic skill
of focusing can be defined as the ability to be concentrated on one object and
then quickly be able to change the focus and concentration on another object.
Most elite athletes have good focusing abilities, however we can often lose
focus none-the-less. We could lose our attention because we are bored. Our
reactions have become automatic requiring less attention, or opponents are not
challenging enough. Many sport psychologists suggest that goal setting should
be re-evaluated so that performance goals are set that are difficult enough to
maintain motivation. But often we are adequately challenged&nbsp; and motivated, but still loose focus.
Sometimes attention cues need to be redefined while performing to ensure that
attention is maintained. This has to do with the task itself, and not motivation.
<i><font color="#0000ff">Figure 8-1, "Performance Flow Chart"</font></i>
asks a series of questions to help us decide what attention problems are
attributing to a weak performance. It is assumed that we are perfectly primed
for the performance. </p>

<p>Now I will walk through the
performance flowchart in figure 8-1. All we do is start at the top, and make
our way down following the arrows. It asks questions in the following order:
<font color="#ff0000">attentional problems, motivational problems, retrieval problems, timing
problems</font>. So lets start at the top with attentional problems. If we <u>cannot
get into deep concentration</u>, then we can practice some attentional
exercises. If we <u>cannot hold onto our concentration</u>, then <u>if it is
anxiety</u>, relaxation exercises can control that. Otherwise, difficulty in
concentration could have to do with motivation. If we <u>are not motivated</u>,
then we re-evaluate performance goals so they are appropriate to keep us
motivated. However, we may be <u>motivated too much</u>, caused by
overtraining. A simple time-out from training can fix this. If none of the
above seem to be an issue, then we can examine the sport task itself. If it is <u>hard
to get into our natural flow style</u>, we re-examine our retrieval cues for
filters and motor responses. Interference can also be the problem. I discuss
this next. If our <u>timing is off</u>, we can use end points as stimulus
control to get it accurate again. If <u>timing is ok, but still not performing
right</u>, check that the retrieval cue triggered at the end point is
correct.</p>

<p>This flowchart is a series of
questions that can help us get started in our self-coaching. It is an example,
and I encourage everyone to make their own more accurate ones. For example, I
could extend this flowchart further to include fixing a specific movement that
is not working. We would take the movement apart, like we do when first
learning or in pre-season, and just try specific parts of the movement. Get it
to flow, and then build it back up again.</p>

<p><b><u><span style="background-color:rgb(249,203,156)">INTERFERENCE</span></u></b></p>

<p>Interference is when two or more automatic skill sets are working at the same time. We feel
spastic. We look spastic. We have lost our sense of self and are confused where
to find it again. The more integrated our athletic style, the more prone we are
to something interfering with it. The more complicated the machine, the more
chance that something can go wrong. It often starts when we are&nbsp; exploring ways to improve. We may find
ourselves attempting new styles and techniques that could interfere with our
default athletic style. <span style="font-size:10pt">And
the worst is the emotional nightmare of seeing all our hard work as athletes,
go for nought, as absolutely nothing is working. But there is hope. And the
tactic is knowledge. The more we know what interference is and how it works,
the better we can get through it, or avoid it altogether.</span></p>

<p>Interference can happen while
learning, and it can happen in recall or performance. Consider the following 3
learning examples. The first causes interference, the second helps learning,
and the third has no effect on learning. When learning a task <i><font color="#ff0000"><u>somewhat similar</u></font></i> to the one we already
know, we get <font color="#ff0000">interference</font>. If task A is driving a car, which is front steer,
and task B is driving a forklift, which is rear-steer, then <font color="#ff0000">A interferes with
learning B</font>, and learning B interferes with A. When learning a task <font color="#ff0000"><i><u>very similar</u></i> </font>to one we already know, <font color="#ff0000">A
helps learning B</font>. If task A is driving car, front steer, and task B is driving
bus, front steer, then A helps learning B. When learning a task that is <font color="#ff0000"><u><i>totally differen</i>t</u></font> to one we already
know, there is <font color="#ff0000">no effect</font> on or from our previous learning. Interference in
recall and performance follows the same principles as interference in learning.
So<font color="#ff0000"> interference occurs when 2 or more very similar tasks are being retrieved at
the same time</font>. </p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)"><b><u>Preventing Interference</u></b></span></p>

<p>In general, interference in sport is caused by <u><font color="#ff0000">comparing</font></u> two or more
movements or default modes that have <u><font color="#ff0000">subtle differences</font></u>. When we compare
something to something else, these two experiences are in their working memory
at the same time. This will cause these two experiences to associate. It is
anyone’s guess as to how these two experiences will start to associate. The
result is usually interference. There are various precautions that we can take
to avoid interference, and I will explain them with examples.</p>

<p>The<span style="background-color:rgb(234,209,220)">
first example</span> of interference, could be caused by our own self-coaching. We are brainstorming,
trying to figure out new solutions on how to do our movements. To do this we
will probably just imagine ourselves doing something new, before we actually
try it. The problem is that if we start<u><font color="#ff0000"> imagining ourselves doing something
very similar to what our default mode</font></u> is, we will get interference. To
avoid this we could use a <font color="#ff0000"><u>stick man</u></font> in our imaginary experiments, instead of
ourselves. This stick man has the same body proportions and abilities as
ourselves. If we like what the stick man is doing, then we can pretend
ourselves doing the same thing. We then rehearse the new movement, and then
make it our new default mode.</p>

<p>The <span style="background-color:rgb(234,209,220)">second example</span> of
interference occurs when we <u><font color="#ff0000">compare our own movements and style to someone
else’s</font></u>. The automatic styles will be in working memory at the same time,
causing interference. Note that comparing other athlete’s styles will not
interfere, because we are visualizing their bodies doing activity, not our own.
To avoid interference, we use our stick man. <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">When
exploring ideas of our own style, think or pretend that the <u><font color="#ff0000">stick man</font></u> is
doing the activity instead of ourselves. Then, if we like what the stick man is
doing, we imagine ourselves doing the activity.</span></p>

<p>The <span style="background-color:rgb(234,209,220)">last example</span> of interference
occurs when comparing sports that are relatively similar. Specifically, <u><font color="#ff0000">comparing
differences between 2 very similar tasks</font>.</u> Water ski trick skiing and
wakeboarding are different in stance on ski/board, pull-in start trick, and
landing trick, but similar in procedures. Loading, dong trick and aiming,
absorbing landing. Even in same sport activity, very similar aspects should not
be compared. Downhill racers can use explicit cues that trigger control, or
implicit cues that trigger lightness on feet. Either one or the other should be
rehearsed in the brain, but never both at the same time. To avoid interference
when learning 2 very <i><font color="#ff0000">similar tasks</font></i>,
learn explicit control using retrieval cues of the <i><font color="#ff0000">differences</font></i> between the similar tasks. In case of the similar trick
skiing and wakeboarding movements, we would develop retrieval cues for stance,
pull-in and landing, as those are the main differences between the two. In the
case of downhill racing “feels”, we could develop retrieval cues for “control”
and&nbsp; “lightness on feet” that are
different and are learned on separate days. </p>

<p><b><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)"><u>Get Rid of Interference</u></span></b></p>

<p>Despite best intentions, we tend
to experience some form of interference at some point in the many years of
doing sport. When this happens, a <b>time
out</b> is the first defense. Interference fades, as do all things in memory
that are not rehearsed. When the interference fades, our default mode has a
chance to come out. We could also actively develop <b>retrieval cues</b> for the parts that work, and ignore the stuff that
does not work. If we have lost our default mode completely, it is possible to <i><font color="#ff0000">regress</font>,</i> using <b>regression techniques</b><i>. </i>We
try to regain memory by looking at video, pictures and other cues of our
performance, or perhaps with hypnosis or other controlled regression measures,
to re-experience our default mode. Then we rehearse our original retrieval cues
to get the default mode to stick, or develop a whole new set of retrieval cues
if things have gotten real messy. Above all, we must be good to ourselves. Be
patient and loving of ourselves. Angst will only increase the amount of time
spent rediscovering lost talent. Time is always the best ally, especially for
well-rehearsed elite athletes.</p>
