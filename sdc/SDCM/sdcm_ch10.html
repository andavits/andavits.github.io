<p><u><span style="font-size:10pt;background:none repeat scroll 0% 0% rgb(255,183,155)"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></span></u></p>

<p>The chapters in the last section
introduced us to very specific ways to control our physical behavior in sport.
In this section, “Control of Emotions and Environment”, the discussion is much
more general. By definition, emotions and environment are complex and
multifaceted, so learning how they work, helps us flow with them. We search for
healthy environments, and attempt to become a part of it. Emotions have a huge
impact on sports performance, so understanding how they work in general is
important. </p>

<p>The working definitions of arousal, stress, and emotions have fuzzy boundaries.
Admittedly, this causes a lot of confusion, not only amongst athletes, but the
scientific community as well. This part of the manual is a general
overview of this area in sport psychology. It does not get into the
micro-managing detail of the learning and performing chapters. Athletes can use
as a general guide from which to study their situation to create a more precise
program for themselves.</p>

<p>Emotions and
arousal are concentrated in the brain stem, so they can influence all
information sent and received from the spinal cord. This is a primitive
survival function; however, the overuse or under-use of these cortical areas
can cause problems. Perception of pain both physically and emotionally
motivates us to get rid of pain. Perceiving something that “feels good”
motivates us to experience it again. Our emotions constantly oscillate up and
down around an equilibrium point. This is how all biological functions occur as
well, so a gentle natural oscillating pattern is normal and healthy. Being
content is the most stable emotional experience, with very little variance.
This is not only a comfortable state to be in, but also the safest. Being
content is the opposite of being manic-depressive. If the state of content is
familiar, we can purposely set an extreme oscillation in arousal and emotion,
knowing that our natural set point, or state of mind, is to be content, which
for us is stable and achievable very quickly. This emotional “up” brings power
and determination to our performance.</p>

<p>As athletes, we
can use arousal and emotions as measuring sticks of how we feel. If we like
what we feel, then we can figure out what to do to ensure we get that feeling
again. What we think, influences how we feel, which in turn can influence our
body’s health and power. Consequently,<font color="#ff0000"> positive affirmations</font>, which means just
thinking in positive constructive terms, has benefit in sport performance, and
our ability to deal with life in general.</p>

<p><u><b><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)">Making Personal Adjustment to Create Harmony</span></b></u></p>

<p>As high end
athletes, we tend to question our abilities and even ourselves quite often. So
what is normal behaviour? What is abnormal behaviour?&nbsp; Using the philosophical principles of
psychology, normal and abnormal behaviour is explained in the following way.
When we change things in our life, we are <b>adjusting</b>
with a goal of creating harmony. Specifically, adjustment means to arrange,
harmonize and come to terms. We arrange parts among ourselves, and in relation
to something else. We make adjustments amongst parts of ourselves. Our goal is
to have harmony of our thoughts, actions and feelings. For example, a person
torn by internal contradictions may want to be loved, but hates people. If a
person has no inner harmony, then we say the person is “<b>badly adjusted</b>” or “<b>disturbed</b>”.
If the person is mentally ill, then we say the person is “<b>unbalanced</b>”. If a person does not fit into a situation or is out of
phase with the world around them, then we say that this person is “<b>out of touch</b>”, “<b>gone</b>”, “<b>way ou</b>t”. Saying
someone is “<b>badly adjusted</b>” is a
value judgement. Making self-changes sometimes comes easy “just like that”,
while at times it requires some skill.</p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10pt;background:rgb(255,183,155)"><br>
</span></b></p>
<p><u><b><span style="font-size:10pt;background:rgb(255,183,155)">EMOTIONS</span></b></u></p>

<p>Now lets look at
what emotions are commonly experienced by athletes. First of all, let’s
understand that emotions are powerful, but not all bad. Positive emotions are
just as powerful as negative emotions. As mentioned earlier, overall positive
mood is good because it increases the overall efficiency of the nervous system;
however, specific moods and emotions are not usually used by international
level athletes because they are hard to replicate and they can distract from <i><font color="#ff0000">flow</font></i>.</p>

<p>Note that we
should not confuse the tensing up of the body in a stressful situation with
emotion. It is quite natural for the face to show strain when the body is in
strain. Easterners call this the natural flow of energy. Many of their martial
arts include making attack noises and faces in their movements, all without
emotion.</p>

<p>Emotions are
symptoms, not causes; so there are no good or bad emotions. If we <font color="#ff0000"><i>do not like</i> </font>what we feel, we can see if
there is anything that you can do to change things for the better. If we <i>do <font color="#ff0000">like</font></i> what we are feeling, we could
see if we can figure out how we can make that continue. Therefore it is
important to listen to our emotions. They are our measuring sticks, telling us
if what we are doing is on right track, or not. Emotions are our first clue
towards answers. </p>

<p>Emotions tend to
follow patterns. A common pattern in sport is the reaction after we have tried
something our hardest. It follows the sequence <font color="#ff0000">ANGER -&gt; DEPRESSION -&gt;
ACCEPTANCE</font> and can last from a few seconds to forever, but is usually around an
hour. This sequence happens regardless of success or not, but is most intense
after a failure. It is best to let the cycle take its natural course and not
interfere. The intensity of this cycle is the same for males and females,
however, social learning defines how long we are in each stage.</p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10pt;background:none repeat scroll 0% 0% rgb(255,183,155)"><br>
</span></b></p>
<p><u><b><span style="font-size:10pt;background:none repeat scroll 0% 0% rgb(255,183,155)">AROUSAL</span></b></u></p>

<p>Another key factor to successful
performance is appropriate arousal. <b>Arousal</b>
is defined in 2 ways. First, it means to <font color="#ff0000">awake from sleep</font> resulting in being
fully conscious, alert and aware. Second, it means to <font color="#ff0000">stimulate to action</font>,
creating a physiological readiness for activity. <b>Activation</b> refers to the energy mobilization required for an
organism to pursue its goals and meet its needs.</p>

<p>The characteristics of <u><font color="#ff0000">physical arousal and activation</font></u> are as follows.
Physical arousal or activation, means the overall extent that the organism is
aroused or activated. It is the activity of processes that provide <i><font color="#ff0000">energy</font></i> for overt behaviour. It is <i><font color="#ff0000">not the actual overt behaviour</font></i>.
Physiologically, it is located in the thalamus, hypothalamus, limbic system and
reticular activating system (RAT). It can be physically measured by observing
muscle tension (eletromyogram), skin conductance, brain activity (EEG), blood
pressure (BP), pulse, body temperature, blood volume in body parts. Arousal
requires the body to metabolize which is the process by which material is
assimilated. Technically, <b>metabolism</b>
means the changes in living cells by which energy is provided for vital
processes and activities.</p>

<p>Now let’s compare
physical arousal and mental awakeness and alertness. We can be very awake and
physically quiet, like when we are sitting and studying for a long time. In
contrast, we can be very unalert and physically aroused. This can happen when
high on a drug like cocaine, or when in a trance state like in distance
running.</p>

<p>The goal of the
athlete is to decide on appropriate arousal and activation. Where is it
occurring during my sports activity? How is it occurring during my sports
activity? Physical activation and mental activation, and they are mutually
exclusive. <b>Physical activation</b> is
appropriate if want to<font color="#ff0000"> <i>increase</i></font> gross
and aggressive movements, while <i><font color="#ff0000">decrease</font></i>
fine movements. <b>Mental activation</b> of
<u><font color="#ff0000">high concentration</font></u> events requires <i><font color="#ff0000">decreasing</font></i>
metabolism in emotional areas, such as limbic and amygdale areas, and <i><font color="#ff0000">increasing</font></i> metabolism in thinking areas,
which are in the frontal cortex. Mental activation of<font color="#ff0000"> <u>low concentration</u></font>
events requires <i>decreasing</i> attention
abilities, so that are in a trance like state. In the diagram <i><font color="#0000ff">“Effects of Arousal on Performance”, figure
10-1</font></i>, note that high arousal is best for gross motor control, while low
arousal is best for complex cognitive events.</p>

<p><u><b><span style="font-size:10pt;background:none repeat scroll 0% 0% rgb(255,183,155)">STRESS</span></b></u></p>

<p>Just like emotions
in general, stress can be good or bad. Let’s move onto a discussion of stress,
starting with some operational definitions. Our goal is to understand stress,
and to influence or control it. <b>Stressors</b>
are adjustment demands. <b>Stress</b>
refers to the effects that <i><font color="#ff0000">stressors</font></i>
have on an organism. <b>Eustress</b> is a
positive stress, while <b>distress</b> is a
negative stress. Both eustress and distress tax resources and coping skills. <b>Coping strategies</b> are methods in
dealing with stress. Stress and coping strategies are integrated and dependent
on each other.</p>

<p>In general, there is
a positive response and negative response to stress. A <b>positive stress response</b> encourages us to MOVE. It increases the activity of all body functions. However, if metabolism is too high, we get
“butterflies”. A <b>negative stress
response</b> creates ANXIETY. The cause can be frustration, anger, worry, fear.
A type A personality is prone to anxiety. The symptoms of an anxious state are
numbness, lack of control, decreased attention span, and decreased
organizational abilities. If anxiety is chronic, one develops constipation,
coronary problems, ulcers, and hives. This is from PNS overcompensation.&nbsp; </p>

<p>More specifically,
scientists study stress by creating “models of stress”. Then each component and
link is checked scientifically. The foundational principles of all models are
as follows. <u><font color="#ff0000">Sources</font></u> of stressors are <i><font color="#ff0000">frustrations</font></i>,
<i><font color="#ff0000">pressures</font></i> and <i><font color="#ff0000">conflicts</font></i>. Vulnerability to these stressors is influenced by the
following characteristics. The <u><font color="#ff0000">nature of the stressor</font></u>, influences the
impact of stress. Stress is increased when stressors are <i><font color="#ff0000">cumulative</font></i>, <i><font color="#ff0000">long in time</font></i>,
of <i><font color="#ff0000">good quality</font></i>, and amount of <i><font color="#ff0000">time given to deal with it</font></i>. The <u><font color="#ff0000">perception
of threat</font></u> by the stressor increases its influence. We&nbsp; can decrease this perceived threat by
developing control of the situation, or developing a tolerance to the
situation. Increasing <u><font color="#ff0000">external resources</font></u> and <u><font color="#ff0000">social support</font></u>,
decreases the vulnerability of stressors. Specifically, the&nbsp; <b>diathesis-stress
model</b> can be used to show one’s vulnerability to stress. Diathesis refers
to ones predisposition to abnormal behaviour. Stress refers to causal factors
that precipitate behaviour.</p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10pt;background:none repeat scroll 0% 0% rgb(255,183,155)"><br>
</span></b></p>
<p><u><b><span style="font-size:10pt;background:none repeat scroll 0% 0% rgb(255,183,155)">ANXIETY, FEAR</span></b></u></p>

<p>Anxiety and fear
are very similar emotions, but understanding their differences is important for
athletes, so we can control these emotions to our benefit. <b>Anxiety</b> is the subjective feeling of apprehensiveness and heightened physiological arousal. There are 2 types of anxiety, trait anxiety
and state anxiety. <b>Trait anxiety</b> is
the inherent personal characteristic to be anxious. <b>State anxiety</b> is a reactive response to a situation. There are 2 types of state anxieties. <b>Cognitive
state anxiety</b> refers to the mental component of state anxiety caused by
fear of negative self-evaluation and a threat to self-esteem. <b>Somatic state anxiety</b> refers to the
physiological affective aspects of anxiety. It is directly related to arousal.
The graph diagram <i><font color="#0000ff">“Effect of Anxiety on
performance”, figure 10-2</font></i>, shows an increase in all anxieties leading up to
a sporting event, followed by a sudden drop in anxieties once the competition
has started.&nbsp;</p>

</div>

<p>So how does
anxiety compare to fear? There are biological and cognitive explanations of
fear. <b>Biological explanation of fear</b>
occurs in the brain. When there is fear, the amygdale is activated. Narrow
responses for fight and flight are wired into the amygdala, so the starter
motor for all body movements are straight from the amygdala, ignoring all
higher-order movements in the frontal cortex. For example, someone with
Parkinson’s disease has a cortical starter motor that is not working, so they
have difficulty moving. However, if a Parkinson’s patient has to avoid danger,
they can, because they are using a different starter motor. The implication for
sport, is to avoid innate fear if the athletic movements are complicated and
integrated. Rehearse in advance specific responses to difficult situations. <b>Cognitive explanation of fear</b> is more
complicated, but we also have the opportunity to develop much control over our
fear reactions using cognitive methods. When experiencing fear, the following
cognitive events happen. An anxiety response to fear sets up blocks in
unpredictable places in the cortex. As a result, we do not have full use of all
our capabilities, including self-actualization. As well, we do not perceive
reality properly. We may not see real dangers, and our judgement is skewed.
Examples of cognitive problems that can result from fears include <i><font color="#ff0000">desensitization</font>, <font color="#ff0000">defensiveness</font>,
<font color="#ff0000">compulsiveness</font>, and <font color="#ff0000">obsessiveness</font></i>.</p>

<p><b><span style="font-size:10pt;background:none repeat scroll 0% 0% rgb(255,183,155)"><br>
</span></b></p>
<p><u><b><span style="font-size:10pt;background:none repeat scroll 0% 0% rgb(255,183,155)">ANGER, AGGRESSION</span></b></u></p>

<p>Aggression can be
categorized as controlled aggression, hostile aggression and crazy aggression.
This manual focuses on <font color="#ff0000">creating controlled aggression</font>. <b>Controlled aggression</b> refers to being aggressive in a controlled
and non-emotional way. Refer to “focus and flow” in this manual. <b>Hostile aggression</b> refers to being
angry or mad. If the athlete is mad, response sets become very narrow and
unpredictable, often ignoring the primed premotor cortical areas. If the
athlete achieves good performance while mad, then they can only achieve the
same performance with the exact same emotions. This is state appropriate
transfer (SAT) explained earlier. <b>Crazy
aggression</b> refers to the state of being desensitized. For example, an
athlete may coach themselves, “do or die”. The athlete can easily make mistakes
in this state, because they are being impulsive.</p>

<p>Athletes who are
naturally talented, may only need to be angry to be able to perform well. This
works up to a point, because everyone eventually hits a down cycle. Anger at
this point only makes the situation worse. There are no short cuts to long-term
excellence. For consistent performances, analysis of why the performance went
well and creating attention triggers for these correct timings are needed. Overall,
it is possible to use anger in a controlled way, but this is much harder to do
than using task-orientated methods.</p>
