<p><b><span style="background-color:rgb(249,203,156)">COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY FOR SPORT</span></b></p>

<p>This chapter uses theories and
methods from the field of cognitive psychology to understand sport. The
generally accepted terms in field of cognitive psychology are as follows. <b>Cognition</b> is the acquisition of
knowledge using mental skills. So what are <b>mental
skills</b>? The ones commonly studied are <font color="#ff0000">pattern recognition</font>, <font color="#ff0000">attention</font>,
<font color="#ff0000">visual memory</font>,<font color="#ff0000"> language</font>, <font color="#ff0000">problem solving</font> and <font color="#ff0000">decision making</font>. So <i><font color="#ff0000">skills are
processes</font></i>. <b>Cognitive psychology</b>
refers to all processes by which sensory input is <b>transformed</b>, <b>reduced</b>, <b>elaborated</b>, <b>stored</b>, <b>recovered</b> and <b>used</b>. </p>

<p>Indeed, our brains analyze the
world in systematic way. We take in information, we sort through the
information received, we store the information in memory systems, and then we
later use this stored information. Loosely speaking, we are a lot like
computers, except we are parallel processors, instead of sequential ones. This
means we can process information extremely fast, but at a lose of accuracy. The
later is a humbling fact, that we should always be checking. </p>

<p>Lets look again at how our brain
analyzes. First we take in information. This is called <b>sensory input</b>. Cognition begins with contact with the external
world. The contact starts when we <b>pay
attention</b> to something, and then <b>recognize
a pattern</b> in it. Then we sort out the information received, resulting in
either reduction or elaboration of this information. <b>Reduction</b> occurs when information is lost. <b>Elaboration</b> occurs when we add to sensory input. For example, when
we meet a friend, we recall shared experiences. This meeting is now added to
these past experiences. After the sensory input has been filtered, it is ready
to be stored in various memory systems. Encoding is first stored in short term
memory. If it is there long enough, it becomes long term memory. Storage in
long term memory does not guarantee recovery. Retrieval processes and
strategies discussed in this manual may increase the probability of pulling
them out. Once the information is perceived, stored and recovered, it can be
used for decision making and problem solving.</p>

<p>Cognitive psychologists have
studied many theoretical systems in how our brains analyze and pass
information. The most practical for sport is the <b>information processing approach</b>. This discipline attempts to show
how we transform information between <font color="#ff0000">stimulus (S)</font> and <font color="#ff0000">response (R)</font>. If a person
has problems performing a task, then the information processing approach may
identify which stage is the primary source of difficulty.</p>


<p>Cognitive psychology also studies <font color="#ff0000">higher cognitive
processes</font>. The elite athlete performing a highly complex and skilled sport uses
higher cognitive processes. The discipline called <b>cognitive science</b> is the study of intelligence in humans, computer
programs and abstract theories, with the emphasis on intelligent behavior as
computation. It attempts to unify views of thought developed by studies in
psychology, linguistics, anthropology, philosophy, computer science and other
neural sciences.</p>
<div><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)"><b><u>Memory types</u></b></span></div>

<p>Recall, <font color="#ff0000">to be able to use
information, it needs to be stored</font>. Lets consider the five main <font color="#ff0000">memory types</font>.
They are called, <font color="#ff0000">semantic</font>, <font color="#ff0000">implicit</font>, <font color="#ff0000">remote</font>, <font color="#ff0000">working</font> and <font color="#ff0000">episodic</font>. They all
decay over time. I listed them in order of <i><font color="#ff0000">most durable to least durable</font></i>. The
operational definitions of these memories are as follows. <b>Semantic</b> memories tell us what words and symbols mean. They are
easy to remember. We can add words to our semantic memories till death. They
are very resilient. <b>Implicit</b>
memories are skills that depend on automatic series of movements, like riding a
bike, swimming, driving a car. They are also conditioned responses, like
reaching for a handkerchief when we sneeze. They are very resilient. <b>Remote</b> memories are data we collected
over years, from schools, magazines, conversations and the like. They appear to
diminish with age, but it could be a <b>retrieval
problem</b>, such as interference. <b>Interference</b>
occurs because we are continuously sorting through the constant accumulation of
information. The new information, can skew or block the old. <b>Working</b> memories, also called <b>short term memories</b> (<b>STM</b>), last only a few seconds. It is
the reception area for all our long term memory banks. It quickly decides what
to hold onto, and which memory bank it will go too. We experience our working
memory in action all the time. When we remember the first part of a sentence,
as we hear the end, it is in working memory. When we do things simultaneously,
like riffling through our mail, talking on the phone, and catching attention of
colleague without losing our place, it is because it is all in our working
memory. Our working memories slow down with age. This can start at forty to
fifty years. <b>Episodic</b> memories, are
recollections of recent experience. Remembering what movie we saw last week, or
where we put our glasses. It can start showing weakness in thirties, but can
become more noticeably weaker in fifties.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(249,203,156)"><b>INFORMATION PROCESSING MODEL FOR SPORT</b></span></p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)"><b><u>Background and Assumptions</u></b></span></p>

<p>Theoretically, the information
processing model is a conceptualization that psychologists have created to show
the process of how learning occurs in our brain. There is no localized learning
center in the brain. Physically, learning occurs when neurons change structure,
as explained in chapter 3. There are some localized hubs through which
selective information flows, and our largest long term storage device
containing all our sport knowledge is located in our frontal cortex, our
forehead.</p>

<p>Now lets explore the information
processing model on a more practical level. There are areas in the nervous
system and brain that can be easily changed, and other areas that cannot. The <b>information processing model</b> shows how
events in the brain promote change; specifically, how the brain receives and
uses information. Our brain uses knowledge we already have along with what we
perceive around and within us, in coordinating everything that happens to
us.&nbsp; By understanding how the information
processing model works, we can gain control over our learning and performing
processes, by identify the stage of primary difficulty or progress. </p>

<p>Our brain influences all our
body functions, and these in turn influence how our brain works. Hence, by
understanding how our mind works, we can use this as another frame of reference
from which to understand and coach athletes. In this section I will have many
highly schematized diagrams of neural firing patterns that develop through the
learning process. Learning is defined as the association between any 2 stimuli.
Recall from chapter 3 that <font color="#ff0000">neuron signals leave the brain, tell the spinal cord
what to do, the spinal cord tells motor neurons what to do</font>. <font color="#ff0000">Then the sensory
neurons send information back to the brain</font>. Lets now start looking at this more
cognitively, meaning what we are thinking what is being transported by the
chemical neuron messengers. My<font color="#0000ff"> “S<i>tick
Man”, figure 4-1</i></font>, takes in sensory information, what it sees and hears, as
well as its kinetic percepts. At the same time it’s brain sends out motor, or
movement, information.</p>

<div style="border:solid black 1.0pt;padding:.2in 0.2in 0.2in 0.2in">
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(204,204,204)">Figure 4-1: Stick Man figure</span></p>

<div style="display:block;text-align:left"><img src="images/fig_4-1.png" width="320" height="268" border="0"></div>
</div>


<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)"><u><b>The Information Processing Model</b></u></span></p>

<p>Now I will describe the <font color="#0000ff"><i>"Information Processing Model”, figure 4-2</i></font>.
There is no physical location in the brain that holds the various parts of the
information processing model. The model describes the brain's overall
capacities and limitations in processing information. We will work through the
model from top to bottom.</p>

<div style="border:solid black 1.0pt;padding:.2in 0.2in 0.2in 0.2in">
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(204,204,204)">Figure 4-2: Information Processing Model</span></p>
<div style="display:block;text-align:left"><img src="images/fig_4-2.jpg" style="width:100%" border="0"></div>
</div>

<p>At the top are the <font color="#ff0000">sensory
filters</font>. They work as follows. There is a constant stream of sensory
information received by the brain. All the sensory information passes through
filters. Some of these filters are inherent and some are learned. We are born
with <b>inherent sensory filters</b>. We do
not have too much control over how they develop. Inherent sensory filters
provide us with information about sensitivity to<font color="#ff0000"> pain</font>, sensitivity to <font color="#ff0000">pressure</font>,
certain <font color="#ff0000">visual </font>and <font color="#ff0000">auditory</font> functions. The reason that we have these filters is
to dull the incomprehensible amount of information that our bodies receive at
any given point in time. These filters also pick out<font color="#ff0000"> relevant information</font> for
the current situation. People with malfunctioning inherent sensory filters have
enormous difficulty in even the simplest life tasks. We also have <b>learned sensory filters</b> which we
develop over time by doing a task. We learn how to respond to different course
situations or plays with ease as our learned sensory filters evolve. The reason
that this happens is because our brain is wired in to protect us from danger.
Events are interpreted as dangerous or not dangerous by our learned sensory
filters. As we master skills, our learned sensory filter<font color="#ff0000"> isolates important
stimuli for sport, from the ones that cause distraction.</font> </p>


<p>So far in the information
processing diagram I've explained that we receive constant influx of sensory
information, which is then passed through inherent and learned sensory filters.
This information is then sent to the <b>working
memory</b> which is also called the <b>short
term memory (STM)</b>. <font color="#ff0000">The working memory develops a "</font><b style="color:rgb(255,0,0)">perception</b><font color="#ff0000">" of what is happening, and decides what to do next.</font>
It decides what sensory filters are to be used, and what knowledge should be
used from the long term memory. It then computes this information and from
that, decides what to do next. It is like the processor in a personal computer.
The working memory is very small. It can hold only <font color="#ff0000">5 units of information, give
or take 2 units</font>. So a person can have a working memory as small as 3 units or
as large as 7 units of information. Why is this important to know? Because we
may have problems in performing some tasks because of "<b>information overload</b>". When the
working memory is asked to do too many things, its performance is unpredictable.</p>

<p><b>Long term memory (LTM)</b> contains knowledge we have learned. Game
plays, course information, sequence of events to be performed, are all stored
in long term memory. There is no limit on amount of information the long term
memory can hold. It can be described analogous to a hard drive in a personal
computer, in that once you have stored something in your hard drive, it can be
retrieved as long as you know where it is and how to access it. Long term
memory has <font color="#ff0000">declarative </font>memories and <font color="#ff0000">procedural</font> memories. <b>Declarative memories</b> are factual information. They can be<font color="#ff0000"> episodic
or semantic</font>. <b>Episodic memories</b> are
temporally dated recollections of personal experiences, analogous to a diary. <b>Semantic memories</b> are general knowledge
that is not associated with time or context. It is analogous to an
encyclopedia. The other type of memory subsystem are <b>procedural memories</b>. These are memories of how we do things, such
as actions, skills and operations. Unfortunately, there is little theory of how
we store procedural knowledge.&nbsp; This is
mostly because of methodological problems which I touch on in my discussions on
attention. </p>

<p>Clearly, the storage and
retrieval of procedures is the main interest for athletes, and hence this
manual. I will infer for this chapter that declarative information is stored
the same way as procedural information with regards to how neurons change
physically and chemically. The difference between declarative and procedural
memories is that procedural information is stored in different parts of the
brain and in different memory pathways from declarative memories.</p>

<p>Once information has been
processed in the working memory, responses are outputted in chunks. The
responses may take place in our mind only, or it may be accompanied by a body
response. In the mind we may respond to a situation by thinking something or
feeling something emotional. In the body, the response may be a change in
internal physiology, like increase in arousal, or it may take the form of
actual body movement. </p>

<p>In summary the information
processing model demonstrates the working memory as the one making the
decisions on what filters and other information from the long term memory are
to be used, and decides on how to respond. So the working memory develops a
"perception" of what is happening, and then responds. </p>

<p>Why would the working memory
want to do all of this in the first place? The need to respond is based on the
biological and physical need for equilibrium. As things change around us, we
have no choice but to change ourselves to maintain equilibrium. The motive to
achieve equilibrium is a fundamental law of nature. It is principle in all
physical aspects of nature as well as aspects of human emotion.</p>

<p>So far I have described the
structure and pathways of the information processing model. Now I will describe
how it works. Lets start by looking at how the model works when we are <u><font color="#ff0000">learning</font></u>
something. According to the information processing model, sensory information
passes through sensory filters and enters the short term memory. Here it is
combined with other knowledge retrieved from long term memory. The longer this
information is in short term memory, the better it is stored in long term
memory. In other words, there is more time to file this information into Long
term memory. Once information is in the long term memory, it is learned.
Theoretically, information in long term memory can be retrieved as long as you
know where it is. It is important to file things in a logical way, so you can
retrieve it easily in the future.</p>

<p>Now, assuming we have learned
our sport, lets look at how the information processing model works when we are
doing, <u><font color="#ff0000">performing</font></u>, something. Our working memory develops a<font color="#ff0000"> <i>perception</i></font> of what is happening and then
decides how the body will respond to this information. This motor information
is outputted in chunks, which travel down the spinal cord to target areas that
would understand the information. These areas, in turn, tell the peripheral
neurons and limbs what to do. The peripheral neurons have direct contact with
muscles and other cells in the body that are not part of the central nervous
system. They can tell your muscles to contract or relax. </p>

<p>In sport, it is very important
that the right sensory filters are retrieved from the<font color="#ff0000"> </font><i><font color="#ff0000">long term memory</font>,</i> as these are paramount in dictating whether you
will achieve a state of flow in your movements. If the wrong filters are
retrieved, strange things can happen. A humorous example of my own
predicaments, concerns my bilingualism. Sometimes I have been confused as to
why I cannot understand something I am reading. This was resolved when I
realized that I was reading in the wrong language. In other words, I was
looking through the wrong filter while reading. When the right filters are
retrieved, a task is easy. The environment that we do our activity in is
usually enough to get the right filter to kick in. Usually when a downhill
skier starts sliding, the appropriate sensory filter is retrieved by working
memory. We can improve the chance that the appropriate filter is retrieved by
using <i><font color="#ff0000">priming techniques</font>,</i> discussed
later. </p>

<p>In summary, the information
processing model, illustrates a steady stream of sensory input, which is then
processed, producing chunks of output. Processing in the working memory works
much the same as with a personal computer: good stuff in, good stuff out,
garbage in, garbage out. Our success can be described by our ability to get the
good stuff in and good stuff out.</p>
<p><br>
</p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(249,203,156)"><b>LEARNING AT NEUROLOGICAL LEVEL</b></span></p>

<p>Understanding
the underlying principles of how learning occurs in the brain and nervous
system, gives us opportunity to control this learning process. Broadly
speaking, the human brain is made of neurons. When neurons change structure,
the result is learning. By default the human brain is always learning or
changing structure. <font color="#0000ff">Recall figure 3-9</font>.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)"><b><u>Association</u></b></span></p>

<p>Specifically,
learning occurs when two or more things are in the short term memory, also
called working memory, at the same time. The events in the memory are said to
be <font color="#ff0000">"<b>associated</b>"</font> together.
This association causes changes in the structure in the brain. In other words,
learning occurs when neurons are associated in a different manner. The longer
the same events are in working memory at the same time, the better chance they
are associated together and stored in long term memory. </p>

<p>Learning
can occur with or without our awareness. An example of learning that occurs
without our awareness could be a song reminding us of a party where the song
was playing. The song has become a retrieval cue for the memory of the party,
without the person consciously rehearsing it. Learning that occurs with our
awareness happens when a person deliberately forces themselves to learn
something. For example, studying the chemical period table for a test or
learning a dance routine.</p>

<p>Theoretically,
with some exceptions, any type of memory trace can be created and associated
with any other memory trace. Common things associated together in sport are
<font color="#ff0000">kinesthetic</font> perceptions, <font color="#ff0000">sensory</font> perceptions, <font color="#ff0000">emotional</font> perceptions and <font color="#ff0000">thoughts</font>,
such as <font color="#ff0000"><i>words</i></font> and <i><font color="#ff0000">mental pictures</font></i>. So an emotion can cue a thought, which cues
a picture in a person’s mind, which cues a movement.</p>

<p>An interesting consequence of
this automatic association, or learning, is a phenomenon called <b>state appropriate transfer.</b> The state
we are in while learning something, can help us recall that thing we were
learning at that time. As examples, if a student studied for exams in a
jacuzzi, then their best recall is in a Jacuzzi. If an athlete has coffee in
their system while training for competition, then their best recall in
performing is with coffee in their system.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)"><b><u>Rehearsal</u></b></span></p>

<p><b>Rehearsal</b> is the key factor in learning
and remembering. We use rehearsal to learn something new. Biologically, a new
association or structure has been created. We can also use rehearsal to prime
the brain of something already learned. Priming activates an existing
association by increasing the metabolism in those parts of the brain. </p>

<p>Good mental rehearsal for learning and priming has the following elements. The
person has to have the <font color="#ff0000">appropriate things</font> in working memory that they want to
associate. They have to be in a deep state of concentration, and the longer we
are in this state, the better learned the material. The <font color="#ff0000">depth of processing</font> -
how many different associations we make - increases better recall of what we
learned.&nbsp; The chart<i> <font color="#0000ff">"Timing of Rehearsals", figure 4-3</font></i>, explains the effects
of speed of rehearsal. In general, learning new things requires slow rehearsal,
while priming can be done in real time or faster than real time.</p>

</div>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)"><b><u>Forgetting and Fading from Memory</u></b></span></p>

<p>So far I have explained how we are wired in to constantly learn things. If we
learn things so well, why are we so forgetful? The diagram<i> <font color="#0000ff">"Forgetful Neurons" figure 4-4 </font></i>explains. Each neuron in
the integrated structure is a retrieval cue. Neurons A and B are both attached
to neuron C. Activating either retrieval cue A or B will activate C. To
retrieve information in neuron C, you can activate A or B as a retrieval cue
for C, or you can activate C directly.&nbsp;
When we <font color="#ff0000">"<b>forget</b>"</font>,
the memory trace is lost, not gone. In my example, forgetting means we cannot
find neuron C, which has the information we want. As well, we cannot find
neurons A or B, which know were C is. In real life, it is not correct to say we
<font color="#ff0000">"<i>forgot</i>"</font> someone’s name.
Instead, we should say we are having troubles<font color="#ff0000"> "<i>recalling</i>"</font> the person's name. Athletes do not forget how to do
the skills in their sport; instead, we are having troubles recalling the
skills. To avoid forgetting, we can learn the skills well and then attach
retrieval cues to those skills.</p>

<div style="border:solid black 1.0pt;padding:.2in 0.2in 0.2in 0.2in">
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(204,204,204)">Figure 4-4: Forgetful Neurons</span></p>

<div style="display:block;text-align:left"><img src="images/fig_4-4.jpg" width="400" height="246" border="0"></div>
</div>

<p><b>Fading</b> is a gradual loss of ideas in
memory. It occurs when something already learned is not primed. Priming is the
rehearsal of triggers that aid recall. Following the reinforcement principle,
if something is not reinforced by actively thinking about that phenomenon
(priming) then it will slowly fade and be replaced by events that are being
currently reinforced (primed). An old style fades out as a new one evolves and
is reinforced by its constant use. Most psychologists agree that memory loss,
unless from degenerative disease or brain injury, is not gone; it is lost,
faded, or perhaps blocked out of consciousness as an anxiety response. "If
you don't use it, you lose it". The human brain must be used and
metabolized to maintain and gain efficiency. It is dynamic and constantly
changing. This is its basic biological structure. This powerful inherent tool
requires maintenance to run efficiently and properly. See diagram<i> <font color="#0000ff">“Fading Neurons”, figure 4-5</font></i>.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)"><b><u>Prototypes</u></b></span></p>

<p>A prototype is an original pattern or model. Prototypes contain filters for
sensory input, and knowledge of motor movements. Together they define our
natural style. Prototype boundaries are fuzzy, and can be changed. We can
create new prototypes and we can change prototypes we have already made. </p>

<p>We have a predisposition to create prototypes, which is rooted in our survival
instinct. Prototypes are used to access the situation quickly. For example, the
word "house" reminds us of a prototype of what a house looks like in
general. The word "running" reminds us of the procedure prototype of
running. There is simply not enough time to make a thorough calculation of
every life occurrence, so we use prototypes to make quick decisions based on
generalizations. Illustrating this point, my cartoon<i> <font color="#0000ff">"Quick Decision", figure 4-6</font></i><font color="#0000ff">.</font></p>

<div style="border:solid black 1.0pt;padding:.2in 0.2in 0.2in 0.2in">

</div>

<p>We have a predisposition to change prototypes, which is rooted in our growing
instinct. We are constantly developing and refining our prototypes. Young
children often act inappropriately on the street because they have not had
enough experience to develop appropriate prototypes for street life. This leads
us to the next magnificent thing that the human brain can do. It is very easy
for humans to do something new. This is absolutely amazing when we consider
that this requires the coordination of billions of cells in both deciding what
it is they are capable of doing and actually doing this novel thing. Yet, we do
this all the time in just fractions of a second! As athletes, there are
constant changes in ourselves, in training and in our competition. We can adapt
easily to these situations because of the flexibility that prototypes allow,
and our ability to learn quickly.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)"><b><u>Analyzing and Integrating</u></b></span></p>

<p>The human brain is divided into
two halves which are simply called the left side of the brain and the right
side of the brain. There are certain tasks which tend to predominate on one or
the other side of the brain. In general, the <b>left brain</b> is the <b>analyzer</b>.
It performs analytical activities that are processed logically and
sequentially. Some things that the left brain is good at are logical and
rational thinking, language, verbal self-instruction, math, planning and goal
setting, and analysis of a complex skill which leads to the construction of how
that skill should be performed. The <b>right
side</b> of the brain is the <b>integrator</b>.
It controls complex activities where many factors are handled together and it
integrates components of a skill into one flowing movement. Some things that
the right brain is good at doing are coordination, the execution of complex
movements in space, integration of complex skills into a flowing movement,
intuition and creativity and visualization. The chart<i><font color="#0000ff"> "Left Brain - Right Brain", figure 4-7</font></i>, sums up the
functions that the left and right brains perform.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Practically, the learning of
skills and training requires the <font color="#ff0000"><i>Analyzer</i></font>.
It finds the problems in technique and sends the information to the <font color="#ff0000"><i>Integrator</i></font><span style="font-size:10pt;line-height:1.5;background-color:transparent">. In other words, it does the
detection and correction part of coaching. Performing athletic skills requires
the Integrator. Specifically, the corrections from the <u>analyzer</u> are <u>integrated</u>
into the complex skill and then performed in a completely coordinated and
flowing way. In other words, the motor responses are run by the Integrator. The
Integrator also performs tactical decisions of competitors and/or the
environment. Cartoon <font color="#0000ff"><i>“Analyzer,Integrator”, figure 4-8.</i></font></span></p>
