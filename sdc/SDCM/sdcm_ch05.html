<p>Our main goal as athletes is to learn skills so that they can be retrieved as
needed in the future. We want the process learned in practice to transfer appropriately
at the tournament. This is called <b>transfer
appropriate processing (TAP)</b>. To achieve this I suggest following the <font color="#0000ff"><i>“Chronology of Learning and Performing” </i>as
outlined in<i> figure 5-1</i></font>. We start by
identifying where we are in abilities on the athletes learning curve. Then we
can set a precise goal for improvement. Then we follow the procedures to learn
the new skill. Once we have learned the new skill, we have to prepare ourselves
for our performance mentally and physically. I call this priming. While we are
actually doing our performance, proper attention skills are required.</p>

Ability</u></b></span></p>

<p>We will start this chapter by
defining athletic development using the information processing model just
explained in chapter 4. Let’s start by looking at <font color="#0000ff"><i>figure 5-2, “Neurological Structures of Development”</i>.</font>
Physiologically, the more integrated a neurological structure, the more we have
learned a skill. For easier understanding, I use hierarchical structure to show
different levels of development. At the beginner level, we learn different
skills, but nothing is integrated, so a lot of mental effort is needed to do
something more complex. At the intermediate level, some things are integrated.
At the mastered level, a whole system of movements are integrated. One thought
of a retrieval cue for that system, and the whole sequence of movements
reflexively happens.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(204,204,204)">Figure 5-2: Neurological Structures of Development</span></p>

<div style="display:block;text-align:left"><img src="images/fig_5-2.jpg" style="width:100%" border="0"></div>
</div>

<p>Now lets consider why this
happens using the components of the information processing model. At the
<font color="#ff0000">mastered level</font>, our sensory filter is so integrated, that one snapshot picture
of the sport situation, gives all information required. Wayne Gretzky, a master
of hockey, was circling the goal net with his back to the play. Once he looked
back towards the play, he immediately noticed that there were too many men on
the ice. He called the referee, who then counted, and then blew the whistle to
stop the play. Gretzky saw play instantaneously, the referee did not. The other
variable component in the information processing model is the motor response.
At the mastery level, one cue from STM initiates a large integrated chunk of
motor responses. When we have mastered something, it <i><font color="#ff0000">feels like “slow motion”</font></i>.</p>


<p>At the <font color="#ff0000">intermediate level</font>, our
sensory filter needs to do more work to get the job done. More than one picture
of the sport situation is required, and more memory space is required for its
integration. The motor response component of information processing model, also
needs to do more things to get the same job done. More than one motor response
is required and more memory space is required to integrate this information. At
the intermediate level, we may<i><font color="#ff0000"> feel like we are “scrambling” </font></i>to get the job
done. At the <font color="#ff0000">beginner level</font>, nothing is integrated, so chaos results.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)"><b><u>Athlete’s Learning Curve</u></b></span></p>

<p><font color="#0000ff"><i>Figure 5-3 </i>visualizes the <i>“Athletic Learning Curve”</i></font>. Notice that it is an <font color="#ff0000">s-shape</font>. At the beginner level, many
small things have to be learned to notice a net effect, so improvement is slow.
At the intermediate level, we are refining technique, chunking smaller learned
units together. Improvement here is quick. At the highest levels, integrating
larger, already complex networks, is complex, so improvement is slow. Also,
notice that improvement happens in a <font color="#ff0000">step-like</font> fashion. This is important for
us to appreciate, so we make sure we have learned our current skill well, before
attempting the next more challenging skill.</p>

<p>I also need to point out that at
different levels of ability, we measure our improved performance in different
ways. Because improvement is very quick at the intermediate level, we can
measure improved performance by having learned new skills. Improvement at the
top level is slow, and is more a refinement of skills, than of learning new
skills. So our main measure of improvement is the decrease in variability of
performance. Then if a new step is reached, we can measure that as our current
level of performance. This procedure is described in detail in chapter 9,
“Setting New Performance Standards.”</p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)">Types of Athletic Styles</span></p>

<p>As we start to master a sport,
we develop our own athletic style. As we advance even further to highest
levels, our uniqueness is emphasized, and our ability to understand our bodies,
tendencies and gait, will help us design a system that could perhaps make us
the best in our discipline. We may find it helpful to create a working
definition of our athletic style. In this manual, I have categorized athletic
style in the following way, and in ch 9, I explain how to set new performance
standards, based on these foundational working definitions.</p>

<p>As stated earlier, athletic
styles continually evolve, and are most noticeable at the mastery level. I call
our current ability and gait “<b>natural
style</b>” or “<b>default mode</b>”. Our
<font color="#ff0000">default mode has 3 parts</font>. It can be proactive or reactive. When we use our <b>proactive mode</b>, we decide what to do,
and then do it. We are using more cognitive control in our performance, and we
have more control over zen-like state. When we use our <b>reactive mode</b>, we are reacting to course, sporting situations. We
use less cognitive control in our performance, resulting in movements that are
more direct spinal and kinetic. </p>

<p>In my working definition, when I
say “default mode”, this means that the sport is being performed in expected
way. There is another mode that kicks in when things go wrong. I call this the <b>rescue response</b> or <b>panic response</b>. So this kicks in when we panic. Do not confuse this
with “reactive mode” where we simply react to the course with no panic. Our
panic response should be pre-planned and rehearsed, just like our default mode.
It may be helpful to create a<font color="#ff0000"> “when shit happens list”</font>. We can compile a list
of <i><font color="#ff0000">saves</font></i>. These are premeditated
techniques that can get us back on track. If the saves won’t work, then we also
have a list of <i><font color="#ff0000">falls</font></i>. We premeditate
where is a good place to fall, and how to fall. Once this practical list is in
place, we need to get the appropriate save or fall to kick in when we panic. We
do this by creating retrieval cues, described in detail in ch 8. A retrieval
cue is something we attach to a save of fall. It can be a word we think, or
something in the environment. So our panic response is created by learning and
rehearsing strategic responses and reactions to panic events, when things go
wrong. Then we attach retrieval cues to this response, which can be something
we cue ourselves, or environmental cues. </p>

<p>The last types of natural styles
to consider, are <b>previous default mode
(previous natural style)</b>. This is our old style from earlier, which can
interfere with our new style. Chapter 8 discusses interference. There is also a
<b>perceived new default mode</b> which
consists of our current natural style and a new skill artificially attached
with a retrieval cue. This procedure is explained in chapter 9. <font color="#0000ff"><i>Figure 5-4&nbsp;
</i>charts the different “<i>Types of
Athletic Modes”</i></font>, and their relation to each other.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(249,203,156)"><b>CYCLE OF LEARNING</b></span></p>


<p>Now I will describe a practical
method that we can use to improve our athletic abilities. Let’s start by defining
the <i><font color="#0000ff">“Cycle of Learning”</font> </i>in 4
principle steps as shown in<font color="#0000ff"><i> figure 5-5</i>.</font>
First we learn new athletic skill. Second we learn a retrieval cue for this
athletic skill. Third, we integrate this new skill into our default mode.
Forth, we create new retrieval cue for our new default mode.</p>

<div style="border:solid black 1.0pt;padding:.2in 0.2in 0.2in 0.2in">
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(204,204,204)">Figure 5-5: Cycle of Learning</span></p>

<div style="display:block;text-align:left"><img src="images/fig_5-5.jpg" width="386" height="400" border="0"></div>
</div>

<p>The <font color="#0000ff"><i>“Practical Flowchart for ‘Cycle of Learning’” in figure 5-6</i>,</font>
diagrams these steps visually. It will be helpful to have this chart handy for
the rest of this section. We start by <b><i>designing</i></b><i> </i><u>motor skill to learn</u>. We have to decide what our new
athletic skill should be. We can use the physiological viewpoint described in
chapter 1 to do this. Recall that we start by figuring out the physics of what
we want to do, then we figure out how our bodies can do this physiologically,
and then we figure out psychological cues that could assist us to achieve this.
(physics &lt;-&gt; physiology &lt;-&gt; psychology). Then we attempt to <b><i>learn</i></b><i> </i><u>this motor skill</u>. A note of
caution. If the skill is not learned on 3 tries, then try something else,
perhaps simpler, perhaps different altogether. This is because after 3 tries,
we are rehearsing bad habits. Assuming we were able to do the new skill, we are
ready to <b><i>rehearse</i></b><i> </i><u>it to
develop consistency</u>. We start by just <u>repeatedly practicing</u> the
skill. Then we create a <u>retrieval cue</u> for this new skill. Chapter 6
explains how to design and rehearse retrieval cues. Finally, we <b><i>integrate</i></b><i> </i><u>this new skill into or default mode</u>.
We do this by thinking of our natural style and new skill <font color="#ff0000">simultaneously</font>, so
they are both in working memory at the same time. Now that we have our new
natural style, we create a new retrieval cue for our new natural style, using
the same method as before. </p>

<p>Now that we have a new ability
in our default mode, we have to repeat this new ability until it becomes
consistent and solid. It is only when we have a solid step, based on our own
consistent performance, that we can advance to the next step. This is what I
call <b>normal training</b>, and it is what
most of training time involves. It may be helpful to consider the following
sequence for normal training: First, visualize performance of skill using
imagery. Then, second, focus on its execution as you would actually perform it.
Then, third, practice doing the skill without analysis. Then forth, experience
the feeling of flow. Then fifth, associate this feeling with a trigger word,
retrieval cue, in your minds.</p>
