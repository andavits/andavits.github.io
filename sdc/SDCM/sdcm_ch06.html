<p><u><b><span style="background-color:rgb(249,203,156)">RETRIEVAL CUES</span></b></u></p>

<p>At the onset of book, we stated that our goal was to learn something in such a way
that it can be retrieved when we want it. A <b>retrieval cue</b> is anything that triggers or aids recall. Our goal
then, is to develop <u><font color="#ff0000">control</font></u> over movements by making retrieval cues for
specific movements and complete flow-like movements. Ideally, a retrieval cue
for sport should be something we can touch or see; anything that can put in a
shoe box, such as a written word, picture, or music. Retrieval cues, such as
the mood, are hard to recreate, and therefore are not as useful for
competition. Training should include the creation of retrieval cues for skills.
Retrieval cues are then rehearsed before training or competition.</p>

<p>There are implicit retrieval cues and explicit retrieval cues. <b>Implicit retrieval cues</b> are always being created. This can be
<font color="#ff0000">advantageous</font> because they are integrated and complex, promoting smooth
movements and mastery. The <font color="#ff0000">disadvantage</font> of implicit retrieval cues is that you
have less control over how and where they are created. <b>Explicit retrieval cues</b> are very precise. They are objectively
defined, whereas implicit retrieval cues are more subjective. Explicit
retrieval cues are usually created and used by the <font color="#ff0000">Analyzer</font>. The Analyzer would
then interrupt the Integrator with specific instructions. In other words, the
flow-like movements run by the Integrator are partially interrupted by the
explicit retrieval cue from the Analyzer. <i><span style="font-size:10pt"><font color="#0000ff">Figure 6-1
“Implicit Explicit Retrieval Cues”</font></span></i>is a drawing of how explicit and implicit
retrieval cue would look at the neurological level.</p>

<p><u><b><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)">How You Make Retrieval Cues</span></b></u></p>


<p><font color="#ff0000">Thinking
of a retrieval cue while at the same time thinking or doing an activity will
create an association</font>. For example, a skier may think "crisp, crisp,
crisp" while doing their crisp-like turns. This will associate the word
"crisp" directly with the movement. Be careful not to think
"this retrieval cue means this movement". In this case, the retrieval
cue will not associate to the movement because the experience of the crisp-like
movement is not in working memory. The <font color="#ff0000">"analytic definition"</font> gets
associated to the word "crisp" but the <font color="#ff0000">"integrated experience"</font>
will not associate with the word "crisp". There needs to be a direct
association of the <i><font color="#ff0000">retrieval cue</font></i> with
the <i><font color="#ff0000">movement</font></i> so that it can be used
to prime the cortical areas later used in "integration". </p>

<p>We can usually tell if a retrieval cue is working properly. When thinking of a
retrieval cue, such as a word or a picture, and at the same time an idea comes
to mind, and is consistent over time, then the retrieval cue is working.
Sometimes, when we perform an activity, we can experience a retrieval
cue in our mind. For example, the word "crisp" may pop into the
skier’s head while performing that crisp-like ski turn.</p>

<p><u><b><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)">Types of Retrieval Cues</span></b></u></p>

<p><i><font color="#0000ff">Figure 6-2 “Retrieval Cues That Trigger Body
Movements"</font></i>, charts various types of retrieval cues. Retrieval cues can
be made for specific body movements, or fully integrated flow-like movements. I
have organized the chart into three categories: Body, Environment and Mind.
These are the main modules of the ABCE diagram described in the Goal Setting
Section, chapter 1. In this diagram, the events of the Mind influence the
happenings of the Body which changes the Environment surroundings, which in
turn causes a different perception in the Mind. This cycle continues forever.
The events of the Mind consist of both Affects (emotions) and Cognitions (what
we are thinking). In my chart, I have categorized retrieval cues that are
created by our body movements, or created by the environmental situation, or
created by what we are thinking and feeling. I further categorize the retrieval
cues in their tendency to be explicit or implicit, and whether they are used by
the Integrator or the Analyzer. The <font color="#ff0000">Analyzer partially interrupts the
Integrator when performing sports</font>.</p>

<p><i><span style="font-size:10pt;letter-spacing:-0.15pt;background-color:rgb(234,209,220)">BODY movements as
retrieval cues</span></i></p>

<p>The movements of our BODY can be used to create and prime retrieval cues. <b>Daily muscle memory</b> promotes very
smooth movements; however, it requires more overt training and we must train
the day before competition. <b>Pretending</b>
is when we simulate the movements of our skills the best we can on land without
any equipment. It directly primes the cortical area that fires off before
engaging in a physical activity. Children cannot visualize, so they have no
choice but to "pretend" to rehearse their implicit cognitions. </p>

<p><i><span style="font-size:10pt;letter-spacing:-0.15pt;background-color:rgb(234,209,220)">ENVIRONMENT as
retrieval cues</span></i></p>

<p>Something in the situation or competition ENVIRONMENT can be a retrieval cue. The
environment cues the mind, which in turn cues the body on how to respond. </p>

<p><b>Stimulus control</b> is when something in
our environment, which is called a <font color="#ff0000">"stimulus"</font>, has
<font color="#ff0000">"control"</font> of how we are going to react.&nbsp; <b>Explicit
stimulus control</b> is a retrieval cue that interrupts a flow-like movement.
So the<font color="#ff0000"> <u>Analyzer</u></font> sees something in the environment and informs the <u><font color="#ff0000">Integrator</font></u>
of its relevance. A specific marker in a course, a beat in the music, or a play
in the game, could be a trigger to partially interrupt the flow and perform a
premeditated plan. It could be a cue to do a movement differently or more
powerfully, or it could be a verification that the focus for the activity is
correct. This is explained in detail in Performing chapter part called
"End Points as Stimulus Control". <b>Implicit stimulus control</b> is always being used by the Integrator.
The overall situation cues&nbsp; the filters
and responses to use. The overall feel of the course conditions or play are
used as cues on what to do next. <b>State
appropriate transfer (SAT)</b> is a phenomenon where our overall physiological
state and physical environment, becomes a retrieval cue. A student studying for
an exam in a jacuzzi, has best recall in a jacuzzi. An athlete training with
coffee in their system, performs best having coffee in their system. </p>

<p><b>Pictures and videos</b> can be retrieval cues for motor cognitions. Pictures are
stimulus from the environment. Viewing pictures relevant to our sport, primes
our pre-motor movement areas of our brain. The biological explanation was
explained in the physiology section. Pictures give you a lot of implicit
information that promote very smooth performances. Diagrams plotting out a
course or a play are helpful. We should make sure that we draw and look at the
diagram from first person, meaning we look at the diagram as if we are looking
or driving on a road. When rehearsing, <i><font color="#ff0000">integrating</font></i>,
the top of the diagram is closest to us. However, when <u><font color="#ff0000">analyzing</font></u>
situation, the top of the diagram can be the top of the page as it is in
textbooks. Refer to diagram <font color="#0000ff">“<i>Integrator
Rehearsing Diagram ‘Roadmap’</i>”, <i>figure
6-4</i></font>.</p>

<div style="display:block;text-align:left"><img src="images/fig_6-4.jpg" width="400" height="167" border="0"></div>
</div>


<p><b>Music</b> can be an implicit or an explicit retrieval cue. <font color="#ff0000">Implicitly</font>, listening to music can creates an overall mood. Sometimes listening to specific music pieces or
genre of music before competition gets us in the <font color="#ff0000"><i>“right” mood</i></font>. This mood can be
physiological arousal, anger, or emotional calmness. Note that it is difficult
to recreate mood exactly. The re-creation is always approximate. More
<font color="#ff0000">precisely</font>, <font color="#ff0000"><i>music is a math of timing and tone</i></font>, so very specific sequences of
notes and beats can describe a movement or visual idea with up most exactness.
Our abilities in understanding the exactness of music is variable. We say that
a person is “gifted” if they can immediately understand that a timing and tone
is right or wrong. If we have this ability to perceive music timing, then using
it as a retrieval cue can be very useful. </p>


<p><i><span style="font-size:10pt;letter-spacing:-0.15pt;background-color:rgb(234,209,220)">MIND events as
retrieval cues</span></i></p>

<p>The events in the MIND can be retrieval cues. This means that there are no outside
influence to our thinking or feeling. We deliberately conjure up these
experiences. The mind is like a conductor. It has the final decision on what
the body will do. </p>

<p><b>Explicit words</b> are specific words that
can be read and then thought, to cue a specific movement of the body. For
example, reciting the word "arm" while doing a trick, may cue us to
extend arm during that trick. These specific words are beneficial when
learning new skills. <b>Implicit words</b>
are feeling-type words that cue a well-rehearsed complex movement. For example,
the word "smooth" may cue the trick to follow a flow-like state that
is smooth. </p>

<p>So how do we make a word a retrieval cue? If we have done something that <font color="#ff0000">"<i>feels</i>"</font> right, then we should stop
right away and re-experience it again in our mind. The more concentrated we
are, the more efficient learning. This rehearsal by re-experiencing helps keep
the event in short term memory. The longer something is in short term memory,
the more time it has to get stored properly in long term memory. Once in long
term memory we can retrieve it again later, and re-experience it again. To
ensure that the memory is accessible as needed, we attach a retrieval cue to
it. In short term memory we could repeatedly say "crisp" while at the
same time experiencing that crisp-like feeling. The longer the clear experience
and the retrieval cue is in our mind, the better it will be stored as a whole
unit in long term memory. The word "crisp" has become a retrieval
cue. Now, when we read or think of the word “crisp”, that "feeling"
of crispness comes into mind.</p>

<p><b>Visualization</b> can be used by the
Analyzer or Integrator. When <u><font color="#ff0000">learning</font></u> a new skill, the <u><font color="#ff0000">Analyzer</font></u>
visualizes the parts of the movement in slow motion. Then the whole movement is
visualized in slow motion. Then it is visualized in real time, and then finally
the new skill is performed. The<font color="#ff0000"> <u>Integrator</u></font> uses visualization to <u><font color="#ff0000">prime</font></u>
muscle memory and overall performance. Real-time visualization is best to
promote proper timing, while faster-than-real-time rehearsal is used to quickly
prime large chunks of information and review sequences. <i><font color="#0000ff">Figure 6-3 charts “Timing of Rehearsals”</font></i>. </p>

<p>Whether learning
something new or priming existing movements, it is important for the athlete to
understand their visualization point of view. Draw an <font color="#ff0000">"E"</font> on your
forehead. If you drew it so you could read it, then you are mostly internal and
visualize from the perspective of yourself. Athletes in individually-based
sports tend to visualize in this manner. If you drew the "E" on your
forehead so others could read it, then you prefer to visualize in the third
person, so you see yourself as others see you. Athletes in team sports tend to
visualize in this manner. Studies show that top athletes tend to visualize
well. This is a correlation, not a cause of good performance, so it is not an
absolute requirement to visualize. Always visualize in <font color="#ff0000">"video"</font> so
that one movement flows into the next. Visualizing with static
<font color="#ff0000">"pictures"</font> causes movements to stop between “pictures” making
robot-like movements.</p>

<p><u><span style="background-color:rgb(249,203,156)"><b>PRIMING: PREPARATION FOR PERFORMANCE</b></span></u></p>

<p>The goal of all competitive athletes is to do what they planned on tournament day.
Tournaments are a time to reality check, and sometimes reality is hard to
swallow, hence the saying “ it’s tournament day, time to swallow your darts”.
Overall, good performance requires appropriate priming and control of arousal,
emotions and attention. In the Goal Setting Section I suggested ways in which
you could define the basic tasks in your sport. This objective definition of
sport requirements gives clear guidelines as to types of skills to learn. Then
in chapters 5 and 6, I described how to learn these skills along with their
retrieval cues. Now that these variables are learned, it is time to perform the
athletic skills. I begin with a discussion of final preparation for
performance: how to prime, or prepare, the body and mind for the tournament.
Then in chapter 7, I explain events that occur while we actually perform. I
explain the differences between focus and flow while performing, along with the
different types of attention strategies that can be used to promote a focused
or flow-like state.</p>

<p>Recall <font color="#ff0000">"cycle of learning"</font>. New skills are learned and retrieval cues are
attached to them. Then the new skills are integrated into our default mode, and
retrieval cues are attached to it. A pre-competition priming procedure
metabolizes the retrieval cues that we learned. It also involves getting our
body warmed up and in an ideal physical state for what we want to do.
Specifically, priming is the procedure we use to prepare our body and mind for
an activity.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)"><b><u>Priming Body</u></b></span></p>

<p>The ideal pre-competition physical state for a body is achieved with direct
physical intervention and psychosomatic control. Physically, the body is primed
with a warm-up to increase metabolism and arousal. Elite athletes often have
trainers to help them achieve this ideal physical state. <font color="#ff0000">Psychosomatic
interventions </font>are sometimes also used to achieve an ideal arousal state in the
body. Various ways of thinking are used to influence the biochemistry of the
body. (<i><font color="#ff0000">psycho</font></i> means <i><font color="#ff0000">mind</font></i>, <font color="#ff0000"><i>somatic</i></font> means<i><font color="#ff0000"> body</font></i>). Popular methods for
physiological control of arousal are <b>progressive
relaxation</b>, <b>biofeedback</b>, <b>autogenic training</b>, <b>autohypnosis</b>. These techniques are very
structured. We often just want a quick way to change the state of our bodies.
The following may be helpful. <font color="#ff0000">To relax muscles</font>, we can tighten the muscle
group, then loosen that group. <font color="#ff0000">To get aroused and increase adrenaline</font>, we can
increase our heart rate by jumping up and down. <font color="#ff0000">To get more oxygen to our
muscles</font>, we can hyperventilate. <font color="#ff0000">To slow our heart rate</font>, we can hold our breath.
It’s good to keep a journal, to write down the quick methods that work for
you.</p>

<p><u><b><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)">Priming Mind</span></b></u></p>

<p>For good consistent performances, the mind needs to be primed appropriately as
well. There is an area in the brain that fires off just before an activity
performs, as described in chapter 3. A priming procedure using retrieval cues will
control how this area fires off. As retrieval cues are rehearsed, there is an
increase in metabolism in areas of brain required for physical activity. At the
same time there will be a decrease in metabolism in areas of the brain not
required for the physical activity, mainly in the emotional centers of the
brain. So properly learned retrieval cues have a double advantage. They give us
explicit control over the feel of your activity, while at the same time
preventing negative emotions from interfering with your performance.</p>

<p>Different types of retrieval cues should be rehearsed at different points in the athletic
season, as shown in <i><font color="#0000ff">“Retrieval Cues by
Season”, figure 6-5</font></i>. Preseason rehearsal requires rehearsing retrieval cues
for very specific moves, while the on-season may require rehearsing one
retrieval cue to activate a whole response set. When an athlete has troubles
achieving the feeling of flow on the on-season, the retrieval cues for specific
response sets should be rehearsed. These are the same retrieval cues that we
created as our skills levels advanced, as shown in <font color="#0000ff"><i>“Retrieval Cues by Ability Level”, figure 6-6</i>.</font></p>

<br>

<p>So why is it that at a more advanced level, we need fewer retrieval cues to get
the same result? Let’s consider this neurologically. Recall the information
processing model described in chapter 4. Once our brain has decided what to do,
it will send information out in chunks. These info chunks tell the spinal
column what next sequence of movements to perform. So most of our learned
movement series are programmed into the nervous system of our spinal cord and
peripheral nervous system. That is why when we do different sports, we have a
gait that is our own. The advantage is that we can perform these series of
movements quickly. It is physiologically impossible to send messages back and
forth from the brain that fast. There is a noticeable time for information to
pass through our spinal column. If we stub our toe, we hear the crunch long
before we start jumping around in pain. The first message of pain is very local
in acute. Then after a few minutes, the pain is wider and general. Getting back
to using less retrieval cues at the elite level. Consider the concert pianist.
Fingers are racing, yet, we can see the pianist is thinking in giant steps,
perhaps just suggesting a thought every 1 to 3 seconds. They have memorized the
piece in large chunks in the brain, as well as the spinal column linked to
finger movement.</p>

<p>When we are properly primed, we may sense ourselves doing the activity in a
controlled manner. <i><font color="#ff0000">"I feel it, it's happening."</font></i> Will proper training
and priming guarantee of good performance? No. One has to consider events that
occur while performing as well.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)"><b style="line-height:1.5;font-size:10pt"><u>Practical Example</u></b></span></p>

<p>The following is a practical suggestion for rehearsing to get things right, and
rehearsing for when things go wrong. On competition day, we may want to
rehearse all our retrieval cues as soon as we wake up, before any anxiety
creeps in. Rehearse the whole performance in real-time and perhaps faster than
real time. Rehearse the different perceptions that would be experienced while
performing. Also rehearse the actions for when things go wrong: our "when
shit happens list". At the beginning of the season, all our retrieval cues
should be rehearsed. This includes specific movements and whole movements. By
the end of the season, one holistic retrieval cue may be enough. Just as we
step up to compete, we should rehearse the first things that we are to do, so
that those specific movements are in working memory. Performing those first
movements, will trigger the rest of the primed movements.</p>

<p>Recall in my discussion of athletic development, that we develop athletic styles. We
have our default mode consisting of&nbsp; our
proactive and reactive modes. It also includes our rescue or panic response.
These are a set of pre-meditated saves, with retrieval cues attached to them.
These include techniques in balance that can save us when we go off balance,
and techniques of safe ways to fall, if that is inevitable. The practical
benefit is that we can still finish our performance, even if it is not pretty.
The emotional benefit, is that we enter the competition knowing what we have to
do, and also what to do when things go wrong. So we say to ourselves, <font color="#ff0000">“no
matter what, I am ready.”</font> A well rehearsed rescue response set is triggered by
retrieval cues from the environment. This means that the situation triggers the
response. We can control this more by attaching a retrieval cue word, to a
panic situation, which then triggers a response. The same learning principles
apply. Once we have our list of responses, it is usually rehearsed realtime
early in the day, so that our nervous system is fully primed, and then just
before we step out to compete, we can go over the list quick to ensure the
retrieval cues for the responses are activated. Then, when performing, if a
panic situation comes up, our bodies will respond as planned.</p>
