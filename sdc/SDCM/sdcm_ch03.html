<p>To understand how our
experiences, “minds”, and behavior work during sport, it may be beneficial to
understand how the brain and the rest of the nervous system generate these
phenomenon at the biological level. This is the field of <b>biological psychology</b>.
</p>

<p>I will start with a discussion
on nervous system structure, and then a discussion of how bio-chemical
information gets transferred through the nervous system. The nervous system
consists of two major divisions, the central nervous system and the peripheral
nervous system. Refer to diagram<i> <font color="#0000ff">“Nervous
System”, figure 3-1</font></i>. The <b>central
nervous system</b> contains spinal cord and brain. The <b>peripheral nervous system</b> has two divisions, the <b>somatic nervous system</b>, controls
voluntary muscles, while the <b>autonomic
nervous system</b> controls involuntary muscles.&nbsp;</p>

<div style="border:solid black 1.0pt;padding:.2in 0.2in 0.2in 0.2in">
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(204,204,204)">Figure 3-1: Nervous System</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(246,178,107)"><b>PHYSIOLOGY OF CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM</b></span></p>
<p>The central nervous system consists
of a <font color="#ff0000">brain</font> and <font color="#ff0000">spinal cord</font> which contain neurons that trigger all our body
functions. They are encased in bone, keeping them protected. It is assumed that
if anything in our central nervous system is damaged, it cannot be fixed, with
some exceptions. </p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)"><u><b>Brain</b></u></span></p>

<p>We will now concentrate on how
the <b>brain</b> part of the central
nervous system operates. Our brain receives and sorts a steady stream of
sensory information, and sends out chunks of information back to our bodies.
This activity takes place in an area like a head band, stretching from one ear
to the other. Scientists have located the areas in the band where sensory
information is received, and motor information sent, for our bodies. See
diagram<i> <font color="#0000ff">“Sensory Motor Band”, figure 3-2</font></i>.</p>

<div style="border:solid black 1.0pt;padding:.2in 0.2in 0.2in 0.2in">
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(204,204,204)">Figure 3-2: Sensory Motor Band</span></p>

<div style="display:block;text-align:left"><img src="images/fig_3-2.jpg" width="400" height="322" border="0"></div>
</div>

<p>Our brain can influence sport
performance in many ways. We have <font color="#ff0000">architectural twins</font> in our brain that work
simultaneously when we think and/or do physical, motor, movement. One twin area
fires off when we <i><font color="#ff0000">imagine</font></i> doing a body movement, while the other fires off
while actually <i><font color="#ff0000">doing</font></i> a body movement. The only difference between these
architectural twins, which are located right next to each other, is that one
that fires off during body movements has connections to the motor band in our
brain. The principle cortical areas of brain that control how our body moves
are in diagram<i> <font color="#0000ff">“Motor Cortex”, figure
3-3</font>.</i> <font color="#ff0000">Sensory information</font> is received on the <i><font color="#ff0000">back</font></i> side of the motor band,
while <font color="#ff0000">motor information</font> and <font color="#ff0000">execution demands</font> are in the <i><font color="#ff0000">front</font></i> side of the
motor band. The <b>primary motor cortex</b> sends the motor commands to the spinal
cord, while the cells in the <b>premotor and supplementary motor cortex</b> are active
during planning movements, even if movements are never actually executed. Very
generally, the <b>prefrontal cortex</b>
responds to sensory signals that lead to movement. The <b>premotor cortex</b> is active during preparations of movement. The <b>supplementary cortex</b> is active during
preparation before series of rapid movements.</p>

<div style="border:solid black 1.0pt;padding:.2in 0.2in 0.2in 0.2in">
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(204,204,204)">Figure 3-3: Motor Cortex</span></p>

<div style="display:block;text-align:left"><img src="images/fig_3-3.jpg" width="341" height="400" border="0"></div>
</div>


<p>On a practical level, these
architectural twins have interesting consequences. We can imagine doing motor
activity and therefore refine a skill without actually doing it. Another
interesting consequence is that we can often <i><font color="#ff0000">feel</font></i> ourselves doing the sport, just by watching someone else doing
it. Hence the saying<font color="#ff0000"> “<i>learning by osmosis</i>”</font>.
So we can pick up a lot just by watching a good example; however, the mind is
not selective, so if we watch a bad example, we will learn the bad example “by
osmosis” as well. The most important consequence of our twin brain
architectures, is their influence on each other. They are identical twins, so
when one changes, so does the other. When we imagine and feel ourselves doing a
physical activity properly, it will increase the probability of the actual body
movement working properly. The <font color="#ff0000">“<u>during</u> activity area”</font> is highly
influenced by sensory information and emotions present, but we can increase the
probability of it firing off properly by ensuring the <font color="#ff0000">“<u>before</u> activity
area”</font> was firing off properly. </p>


<p>I use the term “<b>firing off</b>”. Let me explain this
further. Our brain and nervous system are composed of neurons which “fire off”
electronically using chemical reactions. This brings us to <b>metabolism</b> in brain. Metabolism is the rate of sugar we consume in
our brain. Sugar fuels the <i><font color="#ff0000">firing off</font></i>
of neurons. The study of metabolism in the brain gives us information on how
the brain works when we are performing tasks. One way to measure metabolism is
with brain scans that show which parts of the brain are being used while
performing a specific behavior. This is done by attaching a die to a sugar, and
then tracing colored sugar’s movement as it is metabolized. In general, <font color="#ff0000">motor
information</font> moves<i><font color="#ff0000"> up and down</font></i> across the brain, while<font color="#ff0000"> visual information</font> moves
from<i><font color="#ff0000"> front to back</font></i>, eyes to occipital lobe, when analyzing information. This is
shown in diagram<i> <font color="#0000ff">“Metabolism of Motor and
Visual Information”, figure 3-4</font></i>.</p>

<div style="border:solid black 1.0pt;padding:.2in 0.2in 0.2in 0.2in">
<p><span><img src="images/fig_3-4.jpg" width="320" height="219" border="0">
</span></p>
</div>

<p>More specifically, metabolism
will vary depending on sports requirements. Lets start with sport requiring<font color="#ff0000"> <u>high
concentration</u></font>, such as ski racing. Metabolism requirements would have us
<i><font color="#ff0000">decrease</font></i> metabolism in <i><font color="#ff0000">emotional</font></i> center, while an<i><font color="#ff0000"> increase</font></i> metabolism in rest
of brain. We can achieve this with pre-planned priming rehearsals, which by
definition will ignore emotions.&nbsp; Now
lets do the opposite and consider sport requiring <u><font color="#ff0000">low concentration</font></u>,
such as long distance running. Runners are in a trance-like state, with eyes
half shut, and therefore are highly suggestible. Metabolism requirements would
have us <i><font color="#ff0000">decrease</font></i> metabolism of <i><font color="#ff0000">emotional</font></i> center, and a <i><font color="#ff0000">decrease</font></i> metabolism in
rest of brain. We achieve this with relaxation procedures. Overall, metabolism
is evident when we are thinking about sport, and/or are having emotions.</p>


<p>So far I have explained how to
turn off emotions, basically by ignoring them, and thereby decreasing
metabolism in the emotional centers. <b>Emotions</b>
are not all bad, and can influence sports performance in positive way as well.
A positive mood affects pathways that increase our overall efficiency and
control of the brain. For example, if you are engaged to be married, it’s a
good time to compete.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)"><b><u>Spinal Cord</u></b></span></p>


<p>Now lets consider the other
important part of our <font color="#ff0000">central nervous system (CNS)</font>, called our <b>spinal cord</b>. Our spinal cord stretches
from the base of our brain, through to our tail bone. It is encased with many
vertebrae bones, so it is both protected and can physically move to some
degree. Every body part has a unique connection to a vertebrae in our spinal
cord. These connection cables are called axons. <b>Axons</b> give and receive information between body parts and spinal
cord.<font color="#ff0000"> Sensory messages</font> enter spinal cord from <i><font color="#ff0000">back</font></i>, and&nbsp; are sent up our spinal cord to our brain
where they are <i><font color="#ff0000">analyzed</font></i>. Then our brain sends a message back to the spinal
cord, which in turn <font color="#ff0000">sends commands</font> through the <i><font color="#ff0000">front</font></i> side of the spine to that
body part. This results in a constant communication between the spinal cord and
brain, and the spinal cord and the body parts. Effectively, the spinal cord is
middle management. The brain gives <font color="#ff0000">managerial orders in bursts</font>, while the
spinal cord executes them. Our so-called <b>“muscle memory”</b> is physically located
in the spinal cord. At least it starts there, giving commands to the peripheral
nervous system. The biggest advantage of our spinal cord is that we can program
very fast, skilled movements right into it. This way, we do not need to send a
signal up to our brain for every little thing, which takes time, making fast
movements physiologically impossible. This is why we all have our unique “<b>gait</b>”. No matter what sport we try, we
always <i><font color="#ff0000">look like</font></i> ourselves. The
reason for slow communication between brain and spinal cord is because it
occurs neuro-chemically. The longer the distance of travel, the longer the wait
state. We can notice this wait state when we stub our toe. We hear the crack,
and then a few moments later we start jumping around in pain.</p>
<p><br>
</p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(246,178,107)"><b>PHYSIOLOGY OF PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (PNS)</b></span></p>

<p>Our peripheral nervous system
(PNS) is a <i><font color="#ff0000">branching neurological structure</font></i>, stemming from our spinal cord. The
neurons of this neurological structure, attach to muscles and tendons, to get
them to tighten and relax. They pick up sensory information from the
environment, as well as from within our body. They also send and receive
information from all the body’s organs. The peripheral nervous system consists
of two parts, the <font color="#ff0000">somatic nervous system</font> and the <font color="#ff0000">autonomic nervous system</font>. </p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)"><u>Somatic Nervous System</u></span></p>

<p>The <b>somatic nervous system</b> controls our <u><font color="#ff0000">voluntary muscles</font></u>. It
contains nerves that transfer messages from sense organs to central nervous
system, and the central nervous system to muscles and glands. See<i> <font color="#0000ff">“Axons Attached to Muscle”, figure 3-5</font></i>.
The best way to understand what somatic system can do in sport, is with
examples.</p>

<div style="border:solid black 1.0pt;padding:.2in 0.2in 0.2in 0.2in">
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(204,204,204)">Figure 3-5: Axons Attached to Muscle</span></p>

<div style="display:block;text-align:left"><img src="images/fig_3-5.jpg" width="200" height="175" border="0"></div>
</div>

<p>Let’s say we want to<font color="#ff0000"> <u>tighten
our muscles</u></font>. What happens in the peripheral nervous system to make this
happen? Recall,<b> </b>that our body is a
branching architecture, so it is important to consider the order in which
things tighten up. If we tighten our elbow, our hand will flop. We have to
think of our hand to tighten it. If we move our fingers, the rest of our arm
tightens to support our fingers. Given the above considerations, let’s say we
want to quickly tighten our muscles. It follows that we should focus on the
external point we want to tighten first. For example, if we are skiing on ice,
we may want everything tight, from ankles to buttocks. To accomplish this we
would focus on ankles first, then knees, and so on inward. Now let’s consider
what happens in our PNS when we <u><font color="#ff0000">change our body position</font></u>. To move our
body in a wavelike manner, we focus on moving trunk first, and then focus in
sequence on every joint outward. Focus from inside to outside. To change the
movement of an extremity fast, we make the change by focusing on that outward
extremity first. Focus from outside to inside. </p>
<div>

<p>Now lets consider the phenomenon
of <u><font color="#ff0000">super human strength</font></u>. Super human strength happens in highly fearful
situations. Normally when our muscles tighten, our tendons tighten as well to
prevent injury to ourselves. During super human strength phenomenon, the
neurons attached to these tendons send<i><font color="#ff0000"> inhibitory</font></i> signals instead of excitatory
signals, so the tendons do not tighten. We cannot control this phenomenon. It
is something that is hardwired in us to save us from grave danger. Another
thing that we have hard wired is <u><font color="#ff0000">self-paralysis</font></u>, caused by muscle
fatigue or injury. When our muscles become fatigued, stop messages are sent
from the spinal cord to those muscle groups. This is a wired-in defense
mechanism designed to prevent injury. If your body receives a strong jolt, from
falling or a body check, this defense mechanism will paralyze the limb
affected. If there is no consequential injury, we will regain use of your limb
in a few minutes once your body’s spinal cord and brain start receiving healthy
signals from the jolted limb. This is an important consideration during injury
rehabilitation as well. When our injured area is fully healed, it will very
quickly return to its original strength and flexibility. So if we are not
feeling power come in quickly and naturally in our limb, more exercise is only
a waste of time, and perhaps even prolongs recovery. Same with flexibility. The
surrounding tissue will maintain its tightness to protect the injured area, no
matter how much effort is spent loosening it. Moral of the story, is to listen
to our bodies, nurturing change, not forcing change.</p>

<p>Now let’s assume we are healthy,
and simply want to <u><font color="#ff0000">increase our power and strength</font></u>. Muscle strength can
be <font color="#ff0000"><i>increased</i></font> by creating healthy <font color="#ff0000">muscle cells</font>, or by<i><font color="#ff0000"> increasing</font></i> <font color="#ff0000">neuron firing
rate and dendrite connections</font> to the muscles. To teach neurons attached to your
muscles to increase firing rate, we concentrate on a specific muscle group
while tightening it. Increasing firing rate, increases the number of excitatory
signals the muscle receives in a given period of time. To increase the number
of dendrite connections to a muscle means that there are more places in a
muscle receiving an excitatory signal, causing the muscle as a whole to tighten
more sharply. Concentrating on the muscle during physiotherapy or workout will
create this effect. In summary, when <i><font color="#ff0000"><b>physical
training</b></font></i>, if we want to change the quality of muscle cells themselves, then
we train with distractions, such as music or video. However, if want to increase
the number of neural connections to the muscles, then we concentrate on
specific muscle group(s) while training. When <i><b><font color="#ff0000">performing our physical activity</font></b></i>, if we want more power for a short
period of time from a specific muscle group, then we focus on that muscle
group,&nbsp; to increase the firing rate of
neurons, and hence the power of the muscle.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)"><b><u>Autonomic Nervous System</u></b></span></p>

<p>The <b>autonomic nervous system</b> is set of neurons which control the body’s
organs, the<font color="#ff0000"> <u>involuntary muscles</u></font>. It has two systems, the sympathetic and
parasympathetic. The <b>sympathetic</b>
system expends energy, encouraging our bodies to move, while the <b>parasympathetic</b> system conserves
energy, encouraging our bodies to relax, grow and heal. The <b>sympathetic nervous system</b> consists of
nerve connections primarily in<font color="#ff0000"> thoracic</font> and <font color="#ff0000">lumbar</font> regions of spinal cord.
Special axons extend to body’s organs, preparing body for <font color="#ff0000">“fight and flight”</font>
activities. They<i><font color="#ff0000"> increase</font></i> heart rate and breathing rate, while <i><font color="#ff0000">decreasing</font></i>
digestion. The name <font color="#ff0000">“sympathetic”</font> is given because all nerves are closely
linked, acting like a single system,<i><font color="#ff0000"> “in sympathy”</font></i> with one another. In
contrast, the <b>parasympathetic nervous
system</b> has functions opposite sympathetic nervous system. <font color="#ff0000">“Para”</font> means
<i><font color="#ff0000">“beside”</font></i> or<i><font color="#ff0000"> “related to”</font></i>. It is also called<b><font color="#ff0000"> craniosacral system</font></b> because its
nerves originate from cranial nerves and sacral spinal cord. Long axons extend
to organs, which operate independently, <i><font color="#ff0000">not “in sympathy”</font></i> with each other.
Parasympathetic activity <i><font color="#ff0000">decreases</font></i> heart rate,<i><font color="#ff0000"> increases</font></i> digestion rate, and in
general promotes energy-conserving, non-emergency functions.</p>
<p><br>
</p>


<p><span style="background-color:rgb(246,178,107)"><b>PHYSIOLOGY OF NEURONS</b></span></p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)"><u><b>Neurons at Micro Level</b></u></span></p>


<p>Our brain and nervous system is
composed of <font color="#ff0000">cells called neurons</font>. Neurons have 3 major components, the <font color="#ff0000">head</font>,
<font color="#ff0000">stem</font> and <font color="#ff0000">branches</font>, as seen in my stylized drawing <i><font color="#0000ff">“Neuron Structure”, figure 3-7</font></i>. The <u><font color="#ff0000">head</font></u> is called the <b>cell</b> <b>body</b>, or <b>soma</b>.<i> <font color="#ff0000">“Soma”</font></i>
means body in Latin. The <u><font color="#ff0000">stem</font></u> is called <b>axon</b>,
from Greek word <i><font color="#ff0000">“axis”</font></i> because it comes from the pole of the neuron. Axons tend
to send information, and look like plumbing tubes. The <u><font color="#ff0000">branches</font></u> are called <b>dendrites</b>. This is from Greek word
<i><font color="#ff0000">“tree”</font></i>. They look like tree branches and receive sensory information. Broadly
speaking, sensory neurons have branches that pick up information and then send
it to the head of the neuron through an axon, while motor neurons send
information through the axon to muscles and tendons. Neurons never physically
attach to each other, but they are always changing shape and form, shown in <i><font color="#0000ff">diagram 3-9, “Physiology of Learning”</font></i>.</p>

<div style="border:solid black 1.0pt;padding:.2in 0.2in 0.2in 0.2in">

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(204,204,204)">Figure 3-7: Neuron Structure</span></p>

<div style="display:block;text-align:left"><img src="images/fig_3-9.jpg" width="400" height="264" border="0"></div>

</div>

<p>So if neurons do not physically
grow together, how do they communicate? Neurons communicate to each other by
sending a message from their head, through their stem and then dendrites. The
dendrites send chemical signals to the head of another neuron in close
proximity. If the other neuron understands the chemical signal, then it will
fire off, sending its message. We <i><font color="#ff0000">cannot change the speed of firing</font></i>, meaning,
the speed at which the message goes down the stem. However, we <i><font color="#ff0000">can increase the
frequency of firing</font></i>. The result is that our neuron’s message is heard more
frequently, and therefore has more powerful consequences.&nbsp; In diagram<i>
<font color="#0000ff">“neuron synapse”, figure 3-8</font></i>, we see Neuron A, which fires an electrical
signal. In the synapse, the area between the neurons, one of A’s connections
touches a receiver of Neuron B. Now Neuron B receives a chemical charge which
triggers an electrical signal in it. That signal gets passed to Neuron C and on
and on. If the connection between A and B is made often enough, the bond
between A and B grows stronger.</p>

<div style="border:solid black 1.0pt;padding:.2in 0.2in 0.2in 0.2in">
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(204,204,204)">Figure 3-8: Neuron Synapse</span></p>
<div style="display:block;text-align:left"><img src="images/fig_3-8.jpg" width="320" height="302" border="0"></div>
</div>

<p>Overall, our brain has billions
of these <b>neurons</b>, also called<b> nerve cells</b>. Many have thousands of
connections through which they send signals to neighboring neurons. Advanced
supercomputers cannot map potential pathways. Unlike cells in our body, neurons
do not divide. They age, and some shrink and die. By age 65 to 70 years, they
can become so feeble that they cannot transmit electrical charges efficiently.
But even then <font color="#ff0000"><i>billions</i> </font>of neurons are
still remaining. They sprout new synapses, forming new connections with one
another. We can encourage synapse growth by keeping ourselves stimulated and
challenged.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)">Neurons at Macro Level</span></p>
<p>Now I will discuss what the
nervous system can do at the macro level. Overall athletes need a keen
understanding of their body functions, especially with respect to our
biological clocks, because at different times, our bodies overall power and
abilities vary. Our body’s nervous system carries a daily, monthly, seasonal
and yearly <b>biological clock</b>. All
body processes function best when the biological clock is set properly. So when
we have jet lag, it is important to&nbsp;
reset our biological clocks. There are a number of ways to do this.
Chemically, the natural product <font color="#ff0000">Melatonin</font>, can reset the brain’s sleep-wake
cycle, but it does not affect all our body processes, which may important for
an athlete. <font color="#ff0000">Light therapy</font> resets all body processes, as it triggers all the
nervous system’s biological clocks. Light therapy works like a swing. Simply
put, the swing is stopped with one burst of light, and then set swinging into
new motion with second burst of light.</p>

<p>Another important phenomenon
linking all our nervous system abilities, is <b>kinesthesia</b>, defined as our ability to perceive our body movements
and position of your body parts in relation to each other and surrounding
space. <b>Kinesthetic perception</b> is the
thinking, watching and concentrating on our movements, and then making a
specific effort to perform them. Generally, kinesthetic perception works on a
conscious level, however, with enough concentration and practice, it can become
automatic, performed subconsciously. There are neurons and neuron structures
that work cooperatively with kinesthesia. <b>Receptor</b>
or <b>sensory receptor</b> is a neuron
specialized to be highly sensitive to a specific type of stimulus. <b>Proprioceptor</b> is a receptor that is
sensitive to the position and movement of a part of the body. <b>Automatism</b> is a non-reflexive yet
unconscious movement. <b>Reflex</b> is an
automatic response to stimulus. <b>Reflex
arc</b> is a circuit of neurons and their connections that are responsible for
producing a reflex.</p>
