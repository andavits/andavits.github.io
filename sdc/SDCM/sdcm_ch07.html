<p>In the Goal Setting Section we created a generalized definition of the tasks
involved in our sport. In Physiology Section I introduced the basic structures
in the brain that are involved in learning and performing. In general, the Left
Brain does the Analyzing, while the Right Brain does the Integrating. I
explained the <i><font color="#ff0000">athlete’s learning curve</font></i>,
and had a suggestion of how the learning curve would look like and function
when an athlete is trying to set new world standards. I suggested that this
extended learning curve could be followed to help make more precise goals
towards improvement. In the "Learning” chapter I suggested techniques that
could be used to reach these goals. Then I discussed rehearsal and recall
methods. Now I will explain the experience of actually performing.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(249,203,156)"><br>
</span></p>
<p><b><u><span style="background-color:rgb(249,203,156)">FOCUS AND FLOW</span></u></b></p>

<p>Focus and flow are words I use to
describe the experience of performing an activity. <b>Focus</b> is when we have complete attention to the execution of a
specific skill. This is performed by the <i><font color="#ff0000">Analyzer</font></i>
in the <i><font color="#ff0000">Left Brain</font></i>.&nbsp; <b>Flow</b>
is the state of being completely engrossed in the execution of a performance to
the exclusion of everything else. This is performed by the <i><font color="#ff0000">Integrato</font>r</i> in the <i><font color="#ff0000">Right Brain</font></i>.</p>

<p>More specifically, we experience
<b>flow</b> when we are exclusively focused
on our performance skills and routine being executed. We only focus on stimuli
relevant to the sport. We are not focused on ourselves, meaning we are not
aware of our own awareness, consciousness or ego. We are not evaluating our
skills as we perform them. We do not experience distractions, such as thinking
about results, judges, audience or expectations. We are not&nbsp; analyzing, meaning we have no conscious
decisions in our mind, or any reasoning with words. Being in flow means
avoiding all psychological game playing, like wanting to win or showing off,
wanting to terrify opponent. Ironically, we can try so hard to achieve correct
state of mind, that we end up distracting ourselves instead. So flow means that
we are in complete control of our <i><font color="#ff0000">actions
and reactions</font></i>. The<font color="#ff0000"> “zen”</font> state of almost pure flow and concentration, is
product of implicit unconscious.</p>

<p><b>Focus</b>, on the other hand, is our internal coach. It can be used to
analyze our sport requirements. We could examine the physical skills we are
executing, the tactics before execution of skills done during priming
procedures, or we could examine the cues of our opponent or course situation.
Focus requirements and cues to look for differ from sport to sport, position to
position. So focus cues us to important strategic points in our performance, we
use a skills-based approach. </p>

<p>Focus is a skill. It is what we
pay attention too. The more precise our focus, the better we are able to use it
as a tool. We can improve our focus skills with practice. To improve
concentrated focus we could practice the following method. Study the object for
some time. Get completely involved with it. Its shape, color, texture, smell
etc. Then switch to another object, and get completely involved with it. We can
do the same method with sounds. Then, once we get a handle on concentrated
focus, we can practice rapidly switching focus from one to another. </p>

<p>Even with good focusing skills, we will find that we start to lose focus as we get
better in our sport skills. This is because our reactions are more automatic,
requiring less attention. In team sports, or opponents may not be challenging
enough. We regain focus by creating new goals. So this is good news actually,
as losing focus signals to us that we are ready for our new next improvement
step. The new performance goals must be realistically achievable, yet difficult
enough to maintain motivation, as explained in chapter 1.</p>

<p><i><font color="#0000ff">Figure 7-1</font> </i>is a cartoon which uses a <i>car analogy</i> to describe the difference between <i><font color="#0000ff">focus and flow</font></i>. Flow can be
compared to cruise control in a car, while focus can be compared to gear
shifting. When learning, we develop retrieval cues for <font color="#ff0000">default mode (cruise)</font>
and <font color="#ff0000">specific skills (gear shifting).</font></p>

<p><b><u><span style="background-color:rgb(249,203,156)">ATTENTION</span></u></b></p>

<p>Finally, here we are, performing
our athletic routine. So what happens when we are performing? More
specifically, how does it happen? Sounds philosophical, but it isn’t really.
What we do is contingent on what we pay attention too. <span style="letter-spacing:-.15pt">The key factor to good performance is good attention. When we mentally
prime retrieval cues for our performance, there is an increase in metabolism in
those areas. The neurons in these areas need a cue to fire off and trigger
other appropriate areas. When we perform, one cue triggers the next cue which
triggers the next, and so on. We achieve good performance with appropriate and
well-timed attention cues.</span></p>

<p>To use this as practical
application for sport, I have some working
definitions for attention. Attention concentration has elements of direction
and depth, as charted in <font color="#0000ff"><i>“Attention
Concentration - Direction and Depth”, figure 7-2</i>.</font> <b>Direction</b> means where our
attention is pointing too. <b>Attention</b> direction can be <font color="#ff0000">selectable, shiftable and
divisible</font>. <b>Selective attention</b> is the capacity to focus cognitive processes on
a narrow band of sensory stimulation. This allows us to choose which stimuli to
attend to, and which stimuli to ignore. <b>Shiftability<font color="#ff0000"> </font>of attention</b> refers to the
ability to focus from one set of stimuli to another. <b>Divisibility of attention</b>
is the ability to separate attention under certain circumstances. For example,
talking and typing at the same time requires dividing attention between those
two tasks.</p>

<div style="border:solid black 1.0pt;padding:.2in 0.2in 0.2in 0.2in">
<p><span style="background-color:rgb(204,204,204)"><span style="line-height:1.5;font-size:10pt;font-family:Times New Roman;letter-spacing:-0.15pt">Figure 7-2: Attention Concentration - Direction and Depth</span></span></p>

<div style="display:block;text-align:left"><img src="images/fig_7-2.jpg" width="320" height="200" border="0"></div>
</div>

<p>Attention
<b>depth</b> means how specific our
attention it. It can be <i><font color="#ff0000">narrow or broad</font></i>.
<b>Narrow</b> attention is looking at micro
elements, like a specific muscle group. <b>Broad</b>
attention is looking at macro panoramas, like a sports field. The most
important aspect of depth is <b>accuracy</b>.
We increase accuracy by decreasing distraction, meaning, we pay attention to
only what is relevant. At the neurological level, it is the sensory filters
that do this screening process. Attentional depth is affected by the <i><font color="#ff0000">efficiency of our working memory</font></i>.
Although we cannot increase the size of our working memory, we can change how
efficiently it operates. To start, just being awake and perky increases the
efficiency of the working memory. Increasing the amount of time we spend
actually using our working memory, increases its efficiency. If you don't use
it, you lose it. By using your working memory, the metabolism in its pathways
and neural structures are stimulated, and will be predisposed to fire off in
the same fashion in the future. A primed and well-functioning working memory
results in smoother performance. <font color="#0000ff"><i>Figure
7-3</i> chart summarizes <i>“Attention
Concentration” </i></font>types<i>.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Now lets consider the <b>types of attention</b>
we can use, and the affects that has on priming and performing. Consider the
chart in <i><font color="#0000ff">figure 7-4, “Attention Types”</font></i>.
Attention type can be of <i><font color="#ff0000">focus or flow</font></i>.
<b>Focused</b> attention type means that
our <font color="#ff0000"><i>conscious self</i></font> controls attention.
We <font color="#ff0000"><i>are aware</i></font> of what we are paying
attention too. It is <b><font color="#ff0000">explicit</font></b>, and
controlled by the <b><font color="#ff0000">Analyzer</font></b>. During
our priming procedures, we rehearse our focus attention abilities by reviewing
timing, movement sequences, and retrieval cues for movements that are different
than our default mode style. When performing, we use<font color="#ff0000"> </font><i><font color="#ff0000">explicit stimulus control</font>,</i> like what we are looking at, triggering
selectable attention. Then we deliberately change something, like changing our
focus, cuing a specific change in movement, or triggering change on overall
flow. <b>Flow</b> attention type means that
our <i><font color="#ff0000">unconscious self</font></i> controls
attention. We <i><font color="#ff0000">are not aware</font></i> of what
we are paying attention too. It is <b><font color="#ff0000">implicit</font></b>,
and controlled by the <b><font color="#ff0000">Integrator</font></b>, as
shown in cartoon <i><font color="#0000ff">“Integrator = Implicit
Attention”, figure 7-5</font></i>.&nbsp; During
priming procedures, we rehearse our filters and motor responses. When
performing, we use <i><font color="#ff0000">implicit stimulus
control</font></i>, like movements themselves, triggering selectable, shiftable,
divisible unconscious attention systems. Using the Analyzer-Integrator analogy,
the Analyzer is the delegator, while the Integrator is the executor. The
priming of retrieval cues for performance is analogous to waking up the
Integrator. So the Integrator is "aroused". When performing, the
Analyzer tells Integrator when to do something and what specifically needs to
be done, "Do this routine now....do that routine now...". The diagram
<i><font color="#0000ff">“Attention While Performing”, figure 7-6</font></i>,
recaps this discussion.</p>

<p><b><u><span style="background-color:rgb(249,203,156)">END POINTS AS STIMULUS CONTROL</span></u></b></p>

<p>Thus far, I have explained how a retrieval cue will start an athletic movement, but
how do we get it to start and stop at the right time? We can control timing by
using attention strategy with end points as stimulus control. <b>Stimulus control</b> is method we can use
to control of sports performance. Specifically, environmental situations cue us
to change something. One such environmental condition is called an <font color="#ff0000">“end point.”</font>
An <b>end point</b> is something we aim
for. We can use "end points" to make deliberate changes in our
athletic style, or to hold onto our attention. End points section off a course.
Sectioning off a course may simply be a cue to signal change, or it may be used
to help finish the current task. The process of using end points as stimulus
control is as follows: <font color="#ff0000">END POINT -&gt; CHANGE SOMETHING -&gt; HOLD TO OTHER END
POINT</font>. Even though we are making deliberate changes in your performance, <i><font color="#ff0000">flow</font></i> should not get fully disrupted
because aiming requires visual and tactical activity. This occurs in the right
side of the brain, in the same area where flow occurs.<font color="#0000ff"> </font><i><span style="font-size:10pt"><font color="#0000ff">Figure 7-7 </font></span></i><span style="font-size:10pt"><font color="#0000ff">describes use of <i>“End Points as Stimulus Control”</i></font>.</span></p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)"><b><u><span style="font-size:10pt;letter-spacing:-0.15pt">How to use end points, step by step</span></u></b></span></p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(234,209,220)"><i>The first step</i></span>: We <font color="#ff0000">“aim for an end
point"</font>. We visualize ourselves <u><font color="#ff0000">moving through</font></u> a premeditated <u><font color="#ff0000">point</font></u>
in a course. We always visualize like a video so the movements are smooth and
continuous. If we visualize a static picture, our movements will become
robotic. In this explanation I have defined an end point as a point that we aim
for and move through. Theoretically, we can also aim for an end point and not
move through it. It is often referred to as <font color="#ff0000">"spotting"</font> a landing. </p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(234,209,220)">The
</span><i><span style="background-color:rgb(234,209,220)">second step</span>:</i> Once we have reached our
end point, it is our cue to <font color="#ff0000">"change something"</font>. When we reach an end
point, our automatic reaction will be <font color="#ff0000">"now what"</font>? There is a delay
between the time we make up your mind on what to do, and the time this
information gets sent through our spinal cord. Most of the delay is in making
up our mind on what to do next. This is almost a zero wait state with mastery. </p>

<p>Now what? What do we change at
end point? Broadly speaking, we could change our athletic style, or we could
change our attention. As far as our athletic style is concerned, we could
change something <i><font color="#ff0000">specific</font></i>, such as
our arm position, or we could give a power punch. A power burst is a narrowly
focused movement, outside our normal flow. It is like “gear shifting” in a car.
Alternatively, we can change our<font color="#ff0000"> <i>feel or
flow</i></font> in athletic style. We could decide to feel “light on feet”, or
“aggressive” or “controlling” in our flow. </p>

<p>As mentioned, the other thing we
could change at the end point is our <i><font color="#ff0000">attention</font></i>.
Sectioning off a course, or routine, helps us hold onto our attention.
Specifically we can change our<font color="#ff0000"> <i>locus of
control</i></font> from external to internal, or <i><font color="#ff0000">focus</font></i>
from close to or from far. An example of <i><font color="#ff0000">changing
focus</font></i>, can be beneficial when we experience “information overload.” This
occurs when we run out of room in our working memory. Recall, our working
memories are small, five plus-minus two units, so we cannot pay attention to
everything at the same time. Its more like a CD. We have lots of information,
but can only look at the small part of what the laser is pointing too. So when
we perform, we cannot think of our whole routine, and strategies. We know we
have them, and have rehearsed them just before competition, so they are readily
accessible, but our memory laser can only look at one small area of our
performance at a time. Practically speaking, we have to decide what to pay
attention too, and what not to pay attention too, at every point in our
performance. Changing <i><font color="#ff0000">locus of control</font></i>,
can be beneficial when we want a small burst of super power. Assuming we
perform our default mode, we can ignore it for a short period of time, up to
one second, and do extreme internal focus on a specific muscle group to create
a super power burst. An elite athlete can safely just let the spinal response,
default mode, run their movements for a short moment. The athlete will have to
“look” at where going or play very soon, but just focussing for a small moments
inward, to execute a focused power burst, is safe. </p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(234,209,220)">The <i>third step</i></span>: The new
change continues until the next end-point is reached, where we have to
change something again. Change direction, change gait, change power etc. We can also choose to be partially focused
inward on specific tasks and partially focused outward looking at where we are
going or what the opponent is doing.</p>

</div>

<p><b><u><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)">Summary</span></u></b></p>

<p>In summary, ask these questions
in sequence to decide appropriate use of end points. <u><font color="#ff0000">To find end point</font></u>,
Where is end point on course? What is my equipment doing at end point? What is
my body position at end point? <u><font color="#ff0000">At end point we change something</font></u>. When we
reach end point, our automatic reaction will be “now what?” What are we
changing, if anything? How are we cuing ourselves to change? Now all we have to
do is <u><font color="#ff0000">hold this to the next end point</font></u>. Where is the next end point?
These questions are the analysis and strategy of what we want to accomplish.
Once we have decided where our end points are and what changes we make there,
we can rehearse this until it becomes automatic. This means, when we are in our
premeditated environment, we will automatically react in our premeditated way.</p>
