<p><span style="color:rgb(255,0,0)"><u>What is it Like to Be the Best at Something?</u> </span><br>
</p>
<p>Maturation takes a full circle.
In human development, we start as dependents, become independent, and then our
final years as dependents. Similarly, using skiing as an example, the beginner
concentrates on where to point their skis, the intermediate skier focuses on
technique, and the elite skier once again focuses on where the skis are
pointing. So what does it mean to be top level? What is a world champion or
world record holder? Is there a mould, or should we consider a paradigm that considers
how to create a world champion? Simply put, the athlete has done something no
person has done before. The athlete is not part of the normal bell curve.
Instead, they are at the top end.</p>

<p>In the introduction I stated the
motive for this manual. The goal of the athlete is to learn and rehearse skills
so they can be retrieved tournament day. The goal of the coach is to help the
athlete reach the above goal. This manual explored the process, not the final
product, to identify, nurture and control an elite athlete’s abilities. As
well, special emphasis was placed on achieving success without negative side
effects, physical and mental. The best in the world experience competition
differently from recreational competitors. During competition, the athlete puts
themselves into a state of abnormality, and then returns to their normal state
after the competition. This occurs physically and mentally, without any
negative consequences. Ideally, during peak competition, the elite athlete may
be in a state of euphoria mentally, and a state of flow, physically. After the
competition the athlete can safely return to normal stasis. However, this may
not always be the case. Alternatively,&nbsp;
the athlete could be terribly anxious, or even in a state of nervous
breakdown because of feeling of responsibility and pressure. Then after
competition the athlete experiences relief. Relief that the competition is
over. The athlete has clearly not enjoyed them selves. So at the elite level,
competitions feel more dramatic, black and white. An elite athlete has to have
a personality that is okay with that.</p>


<blockquote>
“Perhaps
the best approach to sport psychology intervention is to acknowledge that this
discipline is in its infancy, and ironically the group of athletes least
understood are elite athletes.” 
<br>
<font size="1">(from “Burnout in Elite Athletes”, A. Vitols 1994)</font>
</blockquote>


<p>In conclusion, when looking at
the best in the world, we never know what it could be. How could we? No one has
ever done anything like it before. These athletes, upon finding their unique
fit into the universe, realize that they are completely different. The best in
the world at the time. Someone that no one else understands, but all want to
be.</p>

</p>

<p>I believe we
want to be loved and appreciated and cared for by certain people. That may or
may not happen. Legally there are rules of how things should and should not be
done. But none of these things address what we need. What we need we already
have, as we are born into it. The universe brought us here to fit in, and it
will support us all the way if we listen.</p>


<p><i>I wish everyone success on the path to self-actualization.</i></p>

<p><i>In love and light</i></p>
