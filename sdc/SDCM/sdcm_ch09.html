<p>As elite athletes, our goal is
to achieve a zen-like state of flow as we do our sport. For example, a martial
artist learns various moves and initiatives that can be used in attack
situations. There are infinite number of attack situations which all can be
counterattacked with moves learned. So there is a predefined, highly integrated
<i><font color="#ff0000">model</font></i>&nbsp;for martial art that is
effective in all attacks and counter attacks. </p>

<p>Still, we may want to go beyond
our predefined model. Perhaps to break a world record, or perhaps to compensate
for body type. Unique individualized style evolve in world class athletes,
which take into account the athlete’s physical abilities, skills, previous and
current learning, and personality. Each of these styles has its boundaries of
what we can and cannot do. In tough competition, we may want to <font color="#ff0000">“push the
envelope”</font>,meaning we want to break our natural boundaries. We may conclude that
it is the only way we could win. This section will discuss how to break our
boundaries in a controlled, and hence safe, manner.</p>

<p><b><u><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)">Procedural Steps</span></u></b></p>

<p>Recall from chapter 5, Athletic
Development, we saw the graphic representation of the athlete’s s-shaped
learning curve. Refer to <i><font color="#0000ff">figure 9-1, “Extending
the S-Curve”</font></i>. On top I have redrawn the same athletes learning curve. The
daily variability is in blue. The average of daily variability shows
progression is in steps, while the resulting learning curve is the predictable
s-shape. Let’s assume we are at the highest level of the learning curve, and we
still want to improve. The bottom graph magnifies the top end of the learning
curve, so we can dissect and understand how to go about this. So let’s move
along this graph from left to right. Now we are at the top step of the s-curve.
Our variability is little, our step is solid and we are ready to move up to the
next. We start by operationally defining our default mode and its boundaries at
this point. For the best athletes, this could also be the current world
standard or world record. Now we strategize our next step, and would like to
give it a try. The problem is that we do not know for sure if it will work.
Worst, if it does not work, and we have learned this non-working, or
partially-working thing, it will start to interfere with our default mode.
Yikes!</p>

<p>To get around this, I have
strategized a method to create an <i><font color="#ff0000">experimental
mode</font></i>, that we can experiment with, before committing it to our current
default mode. So to start the creation of our new next step, we use attentional
triggers to snap out of default mode in our weak areas, and perform our new
premeditated plan. This is described in more detail in the <font color="#0000ff">procedural steps 1
and 2, of figure 9-2</font>, which I will explain soon. But now, I’d like to point out
the graph. I have drawn our resulting learning curve as a continuum of where we
were, using a dotted line. Now note that the blue line describing variability
in performance. Notice how its variability has sharply increased again as we
try to reach the next step. With time, the variability in performance using
this new premeditated plan, starts to decrease, and we can start to notice a
new natural step in improvement. I call this our <i><font color="#ff0000">experimental mode</font></i>, which we can later turn into our <i><font color="#ff0000">new default mode</font>. </i>From here, the pattern
repeats itself. If our new new premeditated plan is working, our natural step
will form, demonstrated by the decrease in variability in performance. If our
new premeditated plan is not working, then <u>no</u> new natural step will form. So we
nurture progress, we cannot force it. What we can control is our ability to
measure and understand what is happening, which is what this procedure
demonstrates. </p>

<p>Now I will go through the whole process again, using <font color="#0000ff"><i>figure 9-2, “Procedural Steps to New Standard”</i>,</font> as a reference. The
procedure has 4 steps. <span style="background-color:rgb(234,209,220)">Step 1 </span>tells us to operationally define our current
level of performance. It is assumed that we have developed reliable retrieval
cues for our default mode. <span style="background-color:rgb(234,209,220)">Step 2</span> is the experimentation part. We try different
things to see if our performance improves. In the diagram, our current
definition of our default mode is bounded. Then we try “skill A”, and then we
try “skill B”. To try “A” and “B” without creating interference, we use
attentional trigger to snap out of our default mode and try something new. Then
use an attentional trigger to snap back into our flow state of our default
mode. This is demonstrated in <font color="#0000ff">fig 9-3 neurological diagram</font>, discussed later.
Recall from chapter 7, “Attentional Strategies”, the concept of focus and flow.
“Flow” is our natural style, and “focus” is a retrieval cue of some sort that
we deliberately think of to cue us to do something different. Then we use
another premeditated retrieval cue to get us to snap back into our natural flow
state. If what we tried worked, then we do step 3. </p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(234,209,220)"> Step 3</span> incorporated our new
technique into a <b>trial experimental mode</b>.
I also call this a <b>perceived mode</b>,
because to the outside observer, we will look like we have learned and
incorporated the new skill into our default athletic style, but in reality, we
have not. We are still tweaking and experimenting with our new skill. It’s very
quick to learn the new skill up to this point, but it is not yet part of our
permanent natural flow state, that we can perform with “zen”. So let’s start
with incorporating our new skill “A” into a <i><font color="#ff0000">new
perceived default mode</font></i>. I have drawn 2 entities. Our current default mode,
and our new skill “A”. In the same way as we did in step 2, we use attentional
triggers to snap out of our default mode to do skill “A”. Then use another
attentional trigger to snap back into the flow state of our default mode. So
now to the observer, it looks like we have a new skill working in synch with
our default mode. </p>

<p>If we are pleased with our new
experimental/perceived mode, we can finally incorporate our new skill “A” into our <i><font color="#ff0000">new default mode</font></i>. In <span style="background-color:rgb(234,209,220)">step 4</span>, we
incorporate our new skill “A” into our new standard, called <b>new natural style</b> or <b>new default mode</b>.&nbsp; Recall from chapter 6, “Learning”, that when
2 things are in working memory at the same time, they associate together. The
longer we keep them there by rehearsal, the better they associate, and get put
into long term memory, at which point it is learned. So it follows that thinking
or experiencing our default mode and our new skill “A” in working memory at the
same time, that they will associate, so with time our new default mode will now
include skill “A”. Skill “A” is now part of our flowy default mode style.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><u><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)">Neurological Explanation</span></u></b></p>

<p><i><font color="#0000ff">Figure 9-3, “Neurology of Creating New Standards”</font></i>,has the same
procedure drawn out at the neurological level. In the top box we see our
default mode as a large network of neurons. This includes all the smooth
aspects of our performance using concepts previously discussed, such as flow,
cruise control and integrated skills. We want to add a new skill, which is a
much smaller network of neurons. We have to consciously concentrate to do this
skill, and to trigger it to happen at the appropriate time. This used concepts
previously discussed, such as focus and gear shift. We like our new skill, so
now start the process of creating a “perceived experimental mode”. Notice, in
the neurological diagram, that the new perceived mode is held together by the
conscious control of retrieval cues. Also notice the sequence in which the
retrieval cues are triggered. The default mode has a trigger retrieval cue for
the new skill, the new skill is performed, at which point it has a retrieval
cue to do something different, like return back to the default mode. The
default mode has a retrieval cue to initiate it to start up again. So our ability
to deliberately create retrieval cue triggers for all kinds of movements is a
very powerful tool. The default mode and new skill are working harmoniously
together, but are not actually part of each other. In the diagram below, the
default mode and new skill, do become part of each other neurologically. This
is our new standard and it is now all part&nbsp;
if the natural flow of our default mode.</p>

<p><span style="background-color:rgb(182,215,168)"><b><u>Normal Curves</u></b></span></p>


<p>Now that I have explained the
procedure to create new performance standard, I will now apply this idea with a
couple of practical examples. Let’s talk again about what it means to break a
world record. Practically speaking, we have to do something that no one else
has done before. So we have to figure out how we are going to do this, and we
would have to snap out of flow in area where we need super power to break the
record. <i><font color="#0000ff">Figure 9-4, “Normal Curves of
Default Mode and New Standard”</font></i>, shows a graph with 2 normal curves. The one
on the right is our default mode with its average performance defined at the
apex of the curve. The curve slopes to the right, and we see that once in a
blue moon, our bodies have managed to achieve what is the top world standard.
This gives us hope. We can now define our new “perceived default mode” at the
same location as the top average world performance. If the perceived mode is
satisfactory, we can then make it our new standard.</p>
