This is site explores the psycho-social influences on creation and maintenance of Ancient Latvian
Philosophy.<br>
<P>
This study does not imply causality. It is simply an observation and interpretation of correlations in movements of people and the archeological marks they left behind.

Foundation of a culture is based on values.<br>
Foundation of values is based on the philosophies on how the universe works.

<P>

Unique factors of Latvian philosophy:<br> 

1) The Baltic languages, Latvian and Lithuanian, are the oldest indo-european languages still
alive today. Sanskrit being a next-of- kin language. 

<br>2) Latvian philosophy itself is maintained by women in songs called "dainas". All other
philosophy and history of culture have been primarily explained by men. As a result, the whole
<I>feel</i> is different from what we are used to hearing today. 
Ironically, this structure appears to have been the norm troughout the human race, less the last 4000 to 6000 years.
