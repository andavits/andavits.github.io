<DT><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><B>PROBLEMS WITH COACHING:</B></font>
<DD>The methods suggested for coaching elite athletes are a combination
of methods that work well for beginner and intermediate athletes. 
So even though there is a unique way to coach a beginner and an  
entirely different way to coach an intermediate competitor, 
no unique method exists for coaching an expert athlete.   


<DT><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><B>PROBLEMS WITH COACHING RESEARCH:</B></FONT>
<DD>As in most research in psychology, the main focus is to study 
various types of behavior in different groups of people and see 
if there are any "statistically significant" trends. If there are, 
one looks at how they came about, and suggest ways that improvement 
could be made, if necessary. <BR>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>Problem #1:</B> Finding a model.</FONT><BR>
Often we use role models to help learn how improvement can be made. 
Elite athletes are of course role models, so studies focus on what 
makes them special as a <B><I>group</I></B>, ignoring individual differences.   
Trends are discovered and models created based on this elite group; 
so <B><I>good</I></B> competitors can 
become <B><I>very good</I></B> competitors, 
<B><I>but very good</I></B> competitors have 
no model to work with to become <B><I>the best</I></B>.<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>Problem #2:</B>
 Assumption that there is a model for a world champion in the first place.</FONT><BR>
Perhaps it is what makes a person <B><I>special</I></B> that defines 
a world champion. Prototypes define similarities, not differences. 
It is logically inconsistent to define coaching strategies 
based on prototype of how these athletes function, when your 
final goal is to get them to do something no human has done before. 
A prototype creates walls, preventing an athete form reaching 
their full potential.


<DT><FONT FACE="ARIAL"><B>CONCLUSIONS:</B></FONT>
<DD><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">So what can we do to help athletes who are superior and 
incomprehensible to ourselves?</FONT> <BR> 
Instead of searching for a prototype of a world champion, 
perhaps a <B><I>model of a problem solving strategy</I></B> 
to bring out the positive 
differences in athletes could be more appropriate. 

<DL>
<DT><FONT COLOR="#FF0000"><B>Motivational Coaching</B></FONT>
<DD>Studies have shown that most international coaches are 
motivators. This is a correlation, so we cannot conclude that 
therefore motivators are the best kind of coach at this level. 
After all, maybe they are motivators because they are incapable 
of task orientated coaching. <BR>

<DT><B><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Task-orientated Coaching</B></FONT> 
<DD>A learning curve takes an s-shaped form, leveling off at the top, 
elite level. 
The implications are as follows:
<UL>	<LI>Improvement is slow, made with small baby steps.
	<LI>There has to be very little variability in performance 
            in order to make any conclusions on interventions.  
<FONT SIZE=-1>(If you have large variability in your performance, and you did 
something -like change your equipment- and got better, you cannot 
conclude that it was because of your equipment that you got better; 
it could very well just have been another extreme fluctuation in 
performance.)</FONT>
	<LI>The method to learn and prime complex, integrated phenomenon 
is much different and much more difficult to measure than the simple 
things we learnt earlier in life. One has to understand the mechanics 
of how this works in order to make changes. Motivation alone will not do. 
</UL>
So, when you are at the top of the learning curve, 
the <B><I>task</I></B> of defining appropriate <B><I>goals</I></B> and 
<B><I>measures</I></B> for performance are especially important.
