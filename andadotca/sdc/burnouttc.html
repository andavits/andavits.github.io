<b>Introduction</b>
<ul><LI>abnormality defined
<li>grounding framework<br>
  (burnout - actualization continuum: burnout, overtraining, staleness, slumps &#60; - &#62; actualization)
</ul>

<b>Definitions of burnout</b>
<ul>
<li>history of research
<li>operational definition of burnout, lack of agreement
<li>components of burnout syndrome, -&#62; no clear antecedents/etiology
<li>dropout - burnout as only 1 possible determinant of dropout
<li>measures - subjective and objective
</ul>

<b>Models of burnout</B>
<ul>
<li>stress as defined in abnormal psychology -&#62; effect on burnout
	<UL>
	<li>chronic stress -&#62; decomposition
	<li>vulnerability to stressors
		<ul>
		<li>nature of stressor
		<li>perception of stressor (PTSS, panic response, GAS)
		<li>external resources
		</ul>
	<li>response to stress
	<li>link between abnormal psychology models of stress/burnout and sport psychology 
		models of stress/burnout
	</ul>
<li>Smith (1986) cognitive-affective model of burnout
<li>maladaptive reaction to training:
	<ul>
	<li>Henschen (1986) - definition of slump
	<li>Silva (1990) - Training Stress Syndrome (definitions of staleness, overtraining, burnout) 
	</UL>
<li>Schmidt and Stein (1991) - Commitment Model
</ul>

<li>define retroactive interventions, advantages & disadvantages
<li>intervention along burnout continuum
<li>intervention using Smith's cognitve-affective model
<li>criticims of retroactive interventions:
	<ul>
	<li>cognitive reappraisal (assumption that all anxiety/fear irrational)
	<li>retroactive approach in general (can promote negative spiral in elite athlete)
	</ul>
</ul>

<b>Proactive interventions for burnout</b>
<ul>
<li>most literature and coaching programs focus on retroactive
<li>definition of proactive approach
<li>definition of prevention
<li>egalitarian empowering approach
</ul>

<b>Selecting appropriate intervention for burnout</b>
<ul>
<li>step1) define task (mental, physiological, environmental)<br>
    step2) hypothesize how to accomplish task via Smith's & ABCE models
<li>coaches influence over athlete by definition
<li>sport psychology interventions in infancy, especially for elite 
</ul>
