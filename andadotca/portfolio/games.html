&copy 1984 Archived<br>
Written with Basic on TI-994A computer using colour television as screen. Operating system allowed for creation of characters and sound.<P>
<b>A shot-the-target-to-win game.</b><br>Specifically, a man-character makes its way along the top os the screen (while making a funny farting noise...) and the player shoots the gun at the bottom of the screeen to disintegrate him. When hit th eman, fireworks go off as reward.<p>
A simple perpendicular loop structure was used to move man ans missile. When they matched, a subroutine for fireworks and rewards points was initiated. Then the whole game cycle repeated recursively until the programmed stop character on keyboard was depressed.<br>
The keys on the keyboard were reprogrammed for game. The program was gradually built up as more integrated characters and sound files were created.

<b>A drag-and-drop game.</B><br>
This is a foundation concept of image movement, with design intended for the world's 2nd most popular game: house. Reward for playing house is the satisfaction that comes with nurturing.<br>
Specifically, a player can dress a baby, move furniture, make dinner etc. by moving and stacking images representing family members, household items and furniture.<P>
Image movement and stacking can also be used to build things. The reward is the satisfaction of buiding something yourself. With the squre and circle images of this example, you can easily build a house, canoe, smiley face and so on.
